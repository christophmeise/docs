## Share Your Link Effectively

Once your link is set up and you understand how earnings work, the real game begins: **sharing your link in a way that builds trust and drives conversions.**

Here’s how to do it right:

### 1. Choose Platforms Where You Have Trust

Think about where people already value your recommendations:

- **Social Media:** LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube
- **Web:** Blog posts, personal websites, podcasts, eBooks
- **Private Communities:** Newsletters, Telegram groups, WhatsApp communities

The goal isn’t to post everywhere but to post where you already have people listening.

### 2. Weave It into Real Content (Don’t Spam)

Avoid dropping links randomly. Instead:

- Incorporate Scripe into your existing content (e.g., “Here’s the tool I used to speed up this post by 80%”)
- Make your link part of a valuable tip or personal story
- Focus on being helpful over being salesy

### 3. Use Clear CTAs and Your Experience

Posts that perform best usually:

- Share personal experience with Scripe
- Include a clear **Call to Action** (e.g., “Try it here” or “This is my go-to tool for planning content”)

### 4. What to Mention About Scripe
