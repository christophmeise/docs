When it comes to LinkedIn content, most teams face the same three struggles:

- Inconsistent posting
- Lack of time
- Uncertainty about what to post

Scripe addresses these by offering [weekly post ideas](/multiple-posts/ai-powered), a [shared content calendar](/team-plan/team-calendar), and collaborative tools like [feedback and approval processes](/team-plan/content-approval) and [analytics dashboards](/team-plan/team-analytics).

But once you’re [set up](/team-plan/set-up), it’s time to understand a few different ways to make collaboration easy, creative, and consistent:

## 1. Content Interviews & “Good Talks”

Recording casual conversations with your teammates (or clients) is one of the best ways to source content. In Scripe, you can [upload and turn these into post drafts instantly](/multiple-posts/file).

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Always record your calls — even informal ones\! They often contain gold nuggets of content\!

## 2. Plan Together in the Calendar

Use the [Company's content calendar](/team-plan/team-calendar) to:

- Drop in post ideas or campaign themes
- Assign notes or ideas to teammates
- Add links, resources, and deadlines

It keeps everyone aligned and gives structure to the week/month.

## 3. Use the Content Buddy System

The Content Buddy System is all about pairing up team members to support each other through the content creation process.

Instead of doing everything solo, you work with a buddy — someone to bounce ideas off, record content interviews with, give and receive feedback on drafts, and even help boost each other’s posts with thoughtful comments.

It creates a natural rhythm of collaboration and accountability. Over time, you’ll start learning from each other’s content and results, making the process feel less like a task and more like a shared creative flow.

## 4. Celebrate Wins (and Keep Score\!)

Motivate your team (or clients) with a little fun:

- Use [Scripe’s leaderboard](/team-plan/team-analytics) to track top posters or highest reach
- Offer small incentives (e.g., day off, Uber Eats voucher, shoutouts)
- Share feedback and celebrate each other’s posts regularly

Sometimes, showing up consistently is easier when you feel seen and supported.
