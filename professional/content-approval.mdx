Scripe makes it easy to manage content creation across multiple people through a built-in approval workflow. Whether you're working with a social media team, reviewing posts for clients, or managing multiple personal brands, here's how the approval process works inside a personal brand workspace.

## Step 1: Request Review

Once you finish drafting a post in the [post editor](/editor/editor), click **Request Review** (double arrows) on the top right. A window will open where you can:

- Assign the review to a specific teammate
- Set a review due date (optional)

This ensures everyone stays aligned and knows when their input is expected.

## Step 2: Reviewer takes action

The assigned reviewer will receive a notification via email. To review the post, they should:

- Go to their **Personal Brand workspace** (or, if they don’t own one, open the brand where the review was requested)
- Navigate to the **Posts** tab → **Review** tab

In the Review tab, they can:

- Open the posts assigned to them to **Approve or Reject** them, optionally leaving feedback
- **Comment directly on the draft** for suggested edits or discussion. [Here's how →](/editor/editor)

This ensures feedback is captured in context and the process remains transparent for both sides.

## Step 3: Track Review Status

At any time, you can track what stage your posts are in in the **Review** tab: whether they’re waiting on feedback, approved, or still in draft.

There, you'll find different sections:

- **Posts assigned to me**: These are drafts waiting for your review.
- **Posts I sent for review**: These are your own drafts that are currently under review.
- **Approved posts**: Content that’s been approved and is ready to schedule or publish.
- **Rejected posts**: Drafts that were reviewed but sent back for revision.

This is especially useful for larger teams managing multiple people and brands.
