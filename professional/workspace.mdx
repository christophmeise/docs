A **Workspace** is your shared environment in Scripe, where you can collaborate with others to manage multiple personal brands, coordinate content, and streamline LinkedIn activity across your organization.

<Info>
  If you're on the **Starter Plan**, you'll only see one Personal Brand on your Workspace.

## What is a Workspace?

When you subscribe to a **Pro or Agency Plan**, your workspace(s) act as a centralized hub for all Personal Brands. This is where all admin settings, shared resources, analytics, and team coordination live.

Each workspace:

- Can host unlimited **personal brands** (aka LinkedIn accounts connected)
- Can have unlimited [**users**](/team-plan/people) helping manage these brands

<Info>
  **You never pay per user, you pay per personal brand.** That means you can invite collaborators freely without worrying about extra costs. [Learn more about members & roles here →](/team-plan/people)
</Info>

## What lives inside a Workspace?

Once inside a workspace, you’ll find shared access to:

- [**Personal Brands**](/sidebar/home) – All brands under your workspace and their performance
- [**Analytics Dashboard**](/team-plan/team-analytics) – track team performance, post results, and top-performing content
- [**Company Calendar**](/team-plan/team-calendar) – plan content across multiple brands in one shared view
- **Organization Settings** – manage [members & roles](/team-plan/people), [billing](/administration/billing) and [notifications](/team-plan/notifications)

<Tip>
  Everything that powers content creation, including uploading materials, drafting posts, and storing knowledge, lives **inside each** [**personal brand**](/sidebar/home).

## How to Switch Workspaces 🔄

If you're on the Agency Plan, you can have unlimited workspaces. To switch between workspaces:

1. Click your **profile icon** in the top-left corner of Scripe.
2. Select **"Switch workspace."**
3. A menu will appear showing all the workspaces you belong to.
4. Click on the workspace you want to enter (e.g. "Scripe" for your organization, or "Personal").

### What’s the Difference Between Switching a Workspace and a Personal Brand?

  <Card title="Switching personal brand" icon="arrows-down-to-people" color="#9353d3">
    - Changing the brand you're working on _within_ the current workspace.

<Tip>
  You can be part of multiple organizational workspaces and even manage your own personal one alongside them. Just use the workspace switcher to move between them anytime.
