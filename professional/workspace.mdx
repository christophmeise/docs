A **Workspace** is your shared environment in Scripe, where you can collaborate with others to manage multiple personal brands, coordinate content, and streamline LinkedIn activity across your organization.

<Info>
  If you're on the **Starter Plan**, you'll only see one Personal Brand on your Workspace.

## What is a Workspace?

When you subscribe to a **Pro or Agency Plan**, your workspace(s) act as a centralized hub for all Personal Brands. This is where all admin settings, shared resources, analytics, and team coordination live.

Each workspace:

- Can host unlimited **personal brands** (aka LinkedIn accounts connected)
- Can have unlimited [**users**](/team-plan/people) helping manage these brands

<Info>
  **You never pay per user, you pay per personal brand.** That means you can invite collaborators freely without worrying about extra costs. [Learn more about members & roles here â†’](/team-plan/people)
</Info>

## What lives inside a Workspace?

Once inside a workspace, youâ€™ll find shared access to:

- [**Personal Brands**](/sidebar/home) â€“ All brands under your workspace and their performance
- [**Analytics Dashboard**](/team-plan/team-analytics) â€“ track team performance, post results, and top-performing content
- [**Company Calendar**](/team-plan/team-calendar) â€“ plan content across multiple brands in one shared view
- **Organization Settings** â€“ manage [members & roles](/team-plan/people), [billing](/administration/billing) and [notifications](/team-plan/notifications)

<Tip>
  Everything that powers content creation, including uploading materials, drafting posts, and storing knowledge, lives **inside each** [**personal brand**](/sidebar/home).

## How to Switch Workspaces ðŸ”„

1. Click your **profile icon** in the top-left corner of Scripe.
2. Select **"Switch workspace."**
3. A menu will appear showing all the workspaces you belong to.
4. Click on the workspace you want to enter (e.g. "Scripe" for your organization, or "Personal").

  You can be part of multiple organizational workspaces and even manage your own personal one alongside them. Just use the workspace switcher to move between them anytime.
