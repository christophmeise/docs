## What is the Team Workspace?

When you subscribe to a **Team or Enterprise Plan**, your workspace acts as a centralized hub. This is where all admin settings, shared resources, analytics, and team coordination live.

Each workspace:

- Is tied to a single subscription
- Can host up to 10 [**personal brands**](/account/personalbrand)
- Can have unlimited [**team members**](/team-plan/people) helping manage these brands

<Info>
  **You donâ€™t pay per user** in a Team Plan, you pay per [personal brand](/account/personalbrand). That means you can invite collaborators freely without worrying about extra costs. [Learn more about members & roles here â†’](/team-plan/people)
</Info>

## What lives inside a Team Workspace?

Once inside a workspace, youâ€™ll find shared access to:

- [**Personal Brands**](/account/personalbrand) â€“ All brands under your workspace and their performance
- [**Analytics Dashboard**](/team-plan/team-analytics) â€“ track team performance, post results, and top-performing content
- [**Company Calendar**](/team-plan/team-calendar) â€“ plan content across multiple brands in one shared view
- **Organization Settings** â€“ manage [members & roles](/team-plan/people), [billing](/administration/billing) and [notifications](/team-plan/notifications)

<Tip>
  Everything that powers content creation, including uploading materials, drafting posts, and storing knowledge, lives **inside each** [**personal brand**](/account/personalbrand).
