Scripe makes it easy to manage content across multiple **personal brands**. Whether you're setting up LinkedIn content systems for team members or clients (if you're an agency), this guide walks you through how to get your workspace ready and start creating personal brands for each profile.

## 1. Start with the right Plan

To manage multiple personal brands, you need to be in a **Pro or Agency Plan**.

- **Professional Plan:** you can connect **multiple LinkedIn accounts inside one workspace**, with unlimited users collaborating seamlessly. This plan is ideal if you’re running up to three personal brands.
- **Agency Plan:** gives access to **unlimited workspaces**, consolidated billing, and advanced client management features, making it easier (and cheaper per account) as you scale.

If you're an agency and will be setting up Scripe for your clients, jump to the following guides:

- If you're setting up Scripe for a client and you're paying for the subscription, [read this tutorial](/agencies/setup-for-client).
- If your client is paying for Scripe, then they need to invite you to collaborate on their workspace. In this case, [read this tutorial](/agencies/client-setup).

## 2. Set Up Personal Brands

Once your account is created and you're in your workspace:

- Click **Create new personal brand**
- Follow the onboarding steps (you can set the tone of voice and posting frequency per team member or client; you’ll always be able to adjust these later)

### Important: LinkedIn Login Setup

Before setting up a new personal brand, ensure that **you're not logged into any LinkedIn account** in your current Chrome profile.

Why? Because Scripe’s setup will sync with the active LinkedIn login, you don’t want to accidentally sync the wrong one.

<Icon icon="diamond-exclamation" /> **To avoid this:**

- Use a Chrome profile where you're not logged into any LinkedIn account, **or**
- Create a new Chrome profile entirely (you can name it something like “Scripe Setup”)

**Repeat this step for each personal brand you're setting up.**

## 3. Chrome Extension Requirement

Every [personal brand](/account/personalbrand) in Scripe must have the [Scripe Chrome Extension](/account/chrome) installed and connected to their [LinkedIn account](/account/li-connection).

You have two options:

- **Install it yourself** if you manage their account
- **Let the team member or client install it later** from their end

As long as it's connected to the correct LinkedIn profile, Scripe can pull data and assist with scheduling and publishing.

## 4. Final Touches

You’ll wrap up the setup by adding the team member or client to the workspace and [assigning them proper roles and personal brands](/team-plan/people). From here, you can manage [strategy](/content-strategy/content-strategy), post creation, scheduling, and performance, all in one place.
