Working asynchronously means you and your client don’t need to meet live. Instead, they can send you material at their own pace, and you use Scripe to turn that input into content. This is especially useful for busy executives or clients in different time zones.

## 1. WhatsApp Integration (Fastest & Recommended Option)

Scripe integrates with WhatsApp so you can collect your clients' input easily.

- Send your client a short list of **themes or guiding questions** (e.g., _“What’s a recent win you want to share?”_ or _“What’s a challenge your customers are facing right now?”_).
- They send their reply to the connected Scripe WhatsApp with a **voice note or text message**.
- Let them know they don’t need to polish their answers. They can reply just like they would to a friend — raw thoughts, stories, or reflections are perfect.
- The input flows directly into Scripe, to the [Sources](/editor/sources) tab, where you can transform it into ready-to-use posts.

<Tip>
  This is a great way to capture authentic, off-the-cuff thoughts without asking clients to sit down and write.

### How to Connect a Client’s WhatsApp with Scripe

To capture content from WhatsApp, you’ll first need to connect the client’s WhatsApp account to their personal brand in Scripe:

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Select the client’s **Personal Brand**.
3. Scroll to **WhatsApp Connections** and click **Add Connection**.
4. A **QR code** will appear — share this with your client.

<Warning>
  **Important:** The QR code is only valid for 10 minutes. Make sure you’re on a call or available online with your client so they can scan it right away.
</Warning>

Once connected, the client can start sending text messages or voice notes directly from WhatsApp into Scripe.

## 2. Other Ways Clients Can Provide Input

Besides WhatsApp, you can collect all sorts of inputs from clients and upload them to Scripe to repurpose into content:

- **Documents or PDFs** → Strategy decks, case studies, reports.
- **Long-form text** → Blog posts, newsletters, or notes.
- **YouTube or Webinar recordings** → Talks, interviews, or panels.
- **Client Calls** → Meeting recordings (if your client is comfortable sharing them).
- **Async Content Interviews** → Share a short questionnaire (Google Form, Typeform, etc.), then upload their written answers to Scripe.

The goal is to make it easy for your client to share whatever they already have — and let Scripe transform it into LinkedIn-ready posts.
