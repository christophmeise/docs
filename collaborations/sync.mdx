Working synchronously means collaborating with your client in real time — usually through **live content calls** where you capture their ideas, stories, and expertise directly. Instead of waiting for them to send material, you co-create during these sessions and immediately turn the output into content.

## What a Content Call Looks Like

A content call is a focused meeting (usually 60 minutes, held biweekly or monthly) where you guide your client through topics that can be turned into LinkedIn posts.

It should feel like a conversation, not a presentation.

**How to prepare:**

- **Set an agenda**: Choose 2–3 themes aligned with the client’s content strategy (e.g., industry insights, personal stories, recent wins).
- **Bring prompts**: Ask open-ended questions such as:
  - _What’s a recent challenge you or your clients faced?_
  - _What’s a mistake you see others making in your industry?_
  - _What’s one lesson you’ve learned recently that others could benefit from?_

  <Tip>
    Many clients appreciate having the themes or questions sent to them in advance. This helps them feel prepared, especially if you plan to dive deeper into past stories or experiences they may need to refresh their memory on. Sending a short list of themes before each call is a best practice.
  </Tip>
- **Always dig deeper**: Don’t stop at the first answer — ask follow-ups like _“Can you give me an example?”_ or _“What did you take away from that experience?”_ These layers often uncover the most authentic, engaging content.
- **Record everything**: Ensure the call is being recorded so it can be uploaded into Scripe later.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload the recording">
    On your client's Personal Brand dashboard, click on **Create Posts → Upload File to Content**, and upload your meeting recording.

    Toggle on **“Add to Knowledge Base”** to save the file’s content to your Knowledge Base. Scripe will learn from it and generate even more personalized posts over time.

    Once your file is uploaded to Scripe, you'll be taken to a screen that helps you generate and refine LinkedIn post ideas based on your content.

    **What You’ll See:**

    - **Post Ideas:** Scripe generates multiple post drafts based on the file you uploaded (e.g., audio, video, PDF, etc.).
    - **Post Score:** Each post idea is ranked using a **content score**, which evaluates how well the post aligns with key performance factors such as Goal alignment, Engagement potential and Value and insights.
    - **Strategy Tags:** Scripe highlights the strategic intent behind each post, such as: generating leads, attracting partners, educating your audience, building credibility, etc.
    - **Hooks:** Each post suggestion comes with scroll-stopping hooks. You can:
      - Click on the arrows to preview all the different hook variations
      - Favorite the ones you like most
      - Use any hook to instantly create a full post

    <Tip>
      Start with the highest-scoring posts, then refine based on your tone and goals. You can always tweak the hook or structure later in the [post editor](/editor/editor).
