You can create your Scripe account either by clicking **Continue with Google** or **Continue with LinkedIn** to sign up instantly with those accounts, or by email, entering the **verification code** sent to your email in the field provided.

## 1. Name your Workspace

After creating your account, you’ll see any **pending team invitations** or suggestions. Here, you can either click **Request to join** to accept an existing team invitation or choose **Create new workspace** if you want to start your account from scratch.

![Workspace Name Jp](/images/workspace-name.jpg)

To create a new workspace, simply enter your **company name** in the field provided and decide whether to enable **domain access**, which lets anyone with the same email domain join the workspace automatically without needing an invitation.

Once ready, click **Create workspace** to set it up.

<Note>
  If you’re on the **Agency Plan**, you’ll have the flexibility to create and manage multiple workspaces directly within the product.
</Note>

Right after creating your workspace, you’ll go through a short onboarding flow to personalize your setup:

- **Theme:** Choose between light or dark mode (you can change this anytime later).
- **Post Language:** Select your default post language, either English or German.

This ensures your workspace looks and feels the way you want from the start.

## 2. Install the Scripe Extension

Installing the Scripe Extension (available on Chrome and Edge) is an **essential step** to get the full value out of Scripe. The extension connects your LinkedIn profile with Scripe so you can:

- ✅ Retrieve analytics from your LinkedIn posts.
- ✅ Import your past posts to train Scripe on your unique tone of voice.
- ✅ Keep analytics and post history updated automatically.

To make it work, ensure you’re logged into your LinkedIn account in the same browser where the extension is installed.

<Info>
  Your data is protected with industry-leading encryption, and the extension only accesses the information required to keep your LinkedIn content in sync with Scripe.
</Info>

## 3. Finish Onboarding & Select Your Plan

Once you’ve set up your writing style and created your first draft post, you’ll be guided to the final step: choosing the right plan for your needs.

Here’s what to know before selecting your plan and starting your **14-day free trial**:

- **LinkedIn account:** the number of personal LinkedIn profiles you can connect to Scripe.
- **User:** the person who logs into Scripe with their own credentials.
- **Workspace:** the main environment where your content, analytics, and settings are organized.

You can choose between monthly or yearly billing (yearly saves you 20%).

<Tip>
  If you’ve received a special coupon code, this is the moment to use it. Simply click **“Enter it here”** on the plan selection screen and apply your code before completing your subscription. This way, your discount will be activated after the trial period.

## 4. Dashboard Set Up

Once your 14-day free trial begins, you’ll land inside your **personal brand dashboard**. To get the most out of Scripe right away, make sure you complete these final setup steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your LinkedIn account for scheduling">
    On your Scripe dashboard, click the “Scheduling” badge, under your followers and impressions. This will prompt you to connect your LinkedIn account. Once connected, the badge will turn **green**, indicating the connection is active.

    ![Li Connection Jp](/images/li-connection.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your personalized Content Strategy">
    From your dashboard, click **Create content strategy**. You’ll go through a short setup before getting your own personalized content strategy. Your content strategy defines the focus areas, audience, and goals so Scripe can tailor suggestions to you.

    ![Content Strategy Jp](/images/content-strategy.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add information to your Knowledge Base">
    From your dashboard, click **Add Knowledge** and choose one of the three options: from text, from file or from website link. By uploading interviews, links, audio notes, or text, you teach Scripe what matters. This information is used to personalize your content, improve post quality, and generate posts with more precision.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Once all of the above is complete, Scripe will start generating [weekly post suggestions](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered) aligned with your voice and strategy.
</Tip>

## 5. Create your First Post

On your dashboard, click on **Create Posts** in the top left corner. Here you have two options to create posts:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create a Single Post" icon="note-sticky">
    - From [<u>audio</u>](/one-post/audio), [<u>text</u>](/one-post/text), or [<u>blank</u>](/one-post/blank).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Multiple Posts" icon="notes">
    - From a [<u>YouTube video</u>](/multiple-posts/youtube), a [<u>long document</u>](/multiple-posts/file), or from a [<u>Content Interview</u>](/multiple-posts/interview).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  You can also [connect your WhatsApp to Scripe](/integrations/whats-app) to easily turn your voice notes into ready-to-use posts.
</Tip>

## 6. Explore Scripe

- Use the [Calendar](/sidebar/calendar) view to organize your content and track consistency.
- Use the [Inspiration page](/sidebar/inspiration) to repurpose posts or follow creators.
  - Scripe subtly adapts your [tone of voice](/sidebar/tov) to match the tone of your followed creators.
- Check your [Analytics](/sidebar/analytics) tab to learn what works and improve from there.

## Extra Steps for Pro & Agency Plans

### Invite Members to your Workspace

### Add more Personal Brands to your Workspace

When you click on your **workspace name** in the top left corner, a small menu will appear. From there, select **Overview** to access the **workspace view**.

![Workspace Overview Jp](/images/workspace-overview.jpg)

In the workspace view, you’ll see all personal brands connected to your workspace.

A **Workspace** is your shared environment in Scripe, where you can collaborate with others to manage multiple personal brands, coordinate content, and streamline LinkedIn activity across your organization.

To add a new personal brand to your current workspace, click **Add Personal Brand**. You’ll then go through the same onboarding steps (1–4) as you did during the initial setup.

![Workspace View Jp](/images/workspace-view.jpg)

<Danger>
  **Important:** Because the Scripe Extension can only be connected to one LinkedIn account per browser profile, you’ll need to complete the onboarding for each new personal brand in a **separate Chrome or Edge profile**.\
  \
  **Why?** Because the Chrome extension automatically reads the LinkedIn profile you're logged into. If multiple LinkedIn profiles are managed in the same Chrome profile, it can cause errors or sync issues.\
  \
  **Alternatively**, have your client install the extension on their own browser so you don’t need to manage multiple profiles yourself.
</Danger>

<Expandable title="How to set up new Chrome Profiles for each Personal Brand.">

<Info>
  To delete a Personal Brand, go to your Settings → Click on the Personal Brand you want to delete → Delete Personal Brand.

### Create different Workspaces for different Clients

When you subscribe to the **Agency Plan**, each workspace serves as a centralized hub for each of your clients. This setup allows you to keep everything neatly separated per client — from personal brands and users to settings, calendars, and analytics.

Inside each workspace, you can:

- Set up and manage the personal brands of that specific client.
- Invite client-specific users with their own access.
- Keep content, scheduling, and analytics fully organized per client.

To manage or create new workspaces, open the menu by clicking on your workspace name in the top left corner and select **Switch workspace**. There, you’ll see a list of all your workspaces and the option to **Add Workspace**.

![Add Workspace Jp](/images/add-workspace.jpg)

When creating a new workspace, you’ll:

1. **Name the workspace**.
2. **Add users immediately** (or skip and do this later).
3. **Add personal brands** by following steps 1–4 of this guide.

<Danger>
  **Important:** Remember that the Scripe Extension only supports one LinkedIn account per browser profile. For each personal brand you add, make sure to use a **separate Chrome or Edge profile**, as outlined above.\
  \
  **Alternatively**, have your client install the extension on their own browser so you don’t need to manage multiple profiles yourself.
</Danger>
