You can create your Scripe account either by clicking **Continue with Google** or **Continue with LinkedIn** to sign up instantly with those accounts, or by email, entering the **verification code** sent to your email in the field provided.

## 1. Name your Workspace

After creating your account, you’ll see any **pending team invitations** or suggestions.

Here, you can either click **Request to join** to accept an existing team invitation or choose **Create new workspace** if you want to start your account from scratch.

![Workspace Name Jp](/images/workspace-name.jpg)

To create a new workspace, simply enter your **company name** in the field provided and decide whether to enable **domain access**, which lets anyone with the same email domain join the workspace automatically without needing an invitation (their access will still require approval from the workspace admin).

Once ready, click **Create workspace** to set it up.

<Note>
  If you’re on the **Agency Plan**, you’ll have the flexibility to create and manage multiple workspaces directly within the product.
</Note>

Right after creating your workspace, you’ll go through a short onboarding flow to personalize your setup:

- **Theme:** Choose between light or dark mode (you can change this anytime later).
- **Post Language:** Select your default post language, either English or German.

This ensures your workspace looks and feels the way you want from the start.

## 2. Install the Scripe Extension

Installing the Scripe Extension (available on Chrome and Edge) is an **essential step** to get the full value out of Scripe. The extension connects your LinkedIn profile with Scripe so you can:

- ✅ Retrieve analytics from your LinkedIn posts.
- ✅ Import your past posts to train Scripe on your unique tone of voice.
- ✅ Keep analytics and post history updated automatically.

To make it work, **ensure you’re logged into your LinkedIn account in the same browser** where the extension is installed.

<Info>
  Your data is protected with industry-leading encryption, and the extension only accesses the information required to keep your LinkedIn content in sync with Scripe.
</Info>

## 3. Finish Onboarding & Select Your Plan

Once you’ve set up your writing style and created your first draft post, you’ll be guided to the final step: choosing the right plan for your needs.

<Tip>
  If you were added to a workspace, you can skip to the next step ;)
</Tip>

Here’s what to know before selecting your plan and starting your **14-day free trial**:

- **LinkedIn account:** the number of personal LinkedIn profiles you can connect to Scripe.
- **User:** the person who logs into Scripe with their own credentials.
- **Workspace:** the main environment where your content, analytics, and settings are organized.

You can choose between monthly or yearly billing (yearly saves you 20%).

<Tip>
  If you’ve received a special coupon code, this is the moment to use it. Before paying, enter your code by clicking on **Add promotion code**.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Promo codes will only apply after your trial ends and your card is charged.

## 4. Personal Brand Final Set Up

Once all of the above is done, you’ll land inside your **personal brand**.

**Here you can already start scriping!** Try the quick action buttons below the chat or ask it to generate 3 ideas based on a topic you want to talk about ;)

![New Home 1 Jp](/images/new-home-1.jpg)

But to get the most out of Scripe, make sure you complete these final setup steps for better content personalization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add information to your Knowledge Base">
    Open your Knowledge Base from the left sidebar and click `+ New Content Source` on the Overview page.

    **Add at least two items to complete your basic setup**: we recommend starting with personal stories, lessons learned, frameworks, or any insights that reflect your career, expertise, and perspective.

    Read more about what to upload to the Knowledge Base [here →](/knowledge/pb-kb)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your personalized Content Strategy">
    From your dashboard, click **Create content strategy**. You’ll go through a short setup before getting your own personalized content strategy. Your [content strategy](https://scripe.mintlify.app/content-strategy/content-strategy) defines the focus areas, audience, and goals so Scripe can tailor suggestions to you.

    ![Content Strategy Jp](/images/content-strategy.jpg)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Once all of the above is complete, Scripe will start generating [weekly post suggestions](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered) aligned with your voice and strategy.
</Tip>

## 5. Generating Posts with Scripe

From your dashboard you generate posts by:

- using the Chat
- picking one of the weekly content suggestions
- repurposing trending posts or your own top performing posts

But you can also click **Create Posts** in the top left corner to generate posts from specific kinds of inputs. From here you can:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create a Single Post" icon="note-sticky">
    - From [<u>audio</u>](/one-post/audio), [<u>text</u>](/one-post/text), or [<u>blank</u>](/one-post/blank).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Multiple Posts" icon="notes">
    - From a [<u>YouTube video</u>](/multiple-posts/youtube), a [<u>long document</u>](/multiple-posts/file), or from a [<u>Content Interview</u>](/multiple-posts/interview).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  You can also [connect your WhatsApp to Scripe](/integrations/whats-app) to easily turn your voice notes into ready-to-use posts.
</Tip>

## 6. Explore Scripe ;)

- Use the [Tone of Voice](/sidebar/tov) settings to teach Scripe how you write: what feels natural to you, and what doesn’t.
- Use the [Posts](/sidebar/posts) page to easily manage all your content and collaborate with your team.
- Use the [Calendar](/sidebar/calendar) view to organize your content and track consistency.
- Use the [Inspiration](/sidebar/inspiration) page to repurpose posts or follow creators.
- Check your [Analytics](/sidebar/analytics) tab to learn what works and improve from there.

## Extra Steps for Pro & Agency Plans

### Invite Members to your Workspace

If you're on a Pro or Agency plan, you can add multiple members to your organization and assign them different roles and access levels.

**Here's how:**

1. Go to your **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the [People](/professional/invite) tab.
3. In the Members section, click on the **Invitations** tab.
4. Click **Invite** in the top-right corner.
5. Enter the user’s email, choose which Personal Brand(s) they should have access to, and [assign a role](/team-plan/people):
   - **Admin** – Full access to everything: settings, profiles, analytics, publishing.
   - **Team Manager** – Access to all personal brands and analytics, but no publishing.
   - **Content Assistant** – Supports one personal brand only, with limited access.
   - **Personal Brand** – Access is limited to their own Personal Brand dashboard.
   - **Personal Brand + Team Insights** – Own PB dashboard plus team analytics and calendar.
   - **Client** – Basic access to Posts, Calendar, and Analytics only.
6. Send the invite.

![People Jp](/images/people.jpg)

<Info>
  You can assign multiple users to the same brand, or assign one user to several brands. Go to the **Assign users to projects** section (just below the members list), to manage which brands each user has access to.
</Info>

### Add more Personal Brands to your Workspace

When you click on your **workspace name** in the top left corner, a small menu will appear. From there, select **Overview** to access the **workspace view**.

In the workspace view, you’ll see all personal brands connected to your workspace.

A **Workspace** is your shared environment in Scripe, where you can collaborate with others to manage multiple personal brands, coordinate content, and streamline LinkedIn activity across your organization.

![Workspace View Jp](/images/workspace-view.jpg)

To add a new personal brand to your current workspace, click **Add Personal Brand**. You’ll then go through the same onboarding steps (1–4) as you did during the initial setup.

<Danger>
  **Important:** Because the Scripe Extension can only be connected to one LinkedIn account per browser profile, you’ll need to complete the onboarding for each new personal brand in a **separate Chrome or Edge profile**.\
  \
  **Why?** Because the Chrome extension automatically reads the LinkedIn profile you're logged into. If multiple LinkedIn profiles are managed in the same Chrome profile, it can cause errors or sync issues.\
  \
  **Alternatively**, have your client install the extension on their own browser so you don’t need to manage multiple profiles yourself.
</Danger>

<Expandable title="How to set up new Chrome Profiles for each Personal Brand.">
  You can simply create a new Chrome Profile without setting up a new Google account.

  Here's how:

  ![New Chrome Profile Jp](/images/new-chrome-profile.jpg)

  <Tip>
    **Tip:** Name your Profile with a reference to your client.
  </Tip>
</Expandable>

<Info>
  To delete a Personal Brand, go to your Settings → Click on the Personal Brand you want to delete → Delete Personal Brand.
</Info>

### Create different Workspaces for different Clients

When you subscribe to the **Agency Plan**, each workspace serves as a centralized hub for each of your clients. This setup allows you to keep everything neatly separated per client — from personal brands and users to settings, calendars, and analytics.

Inside each workspace, you can:

- Set up and manage the personal brands of that specific client.
- Invite client-specific users with their own access.
- Keep content, scheduling, and analytics fully organized per client.

To manage or create new workspaces, open the menu by clicking on your workspace name in the top left corner and select **Switch workspace**. There, you’ll see a list of all your workspaces and the option to **Add Workspace**.

![Add Workspace Jp](/images/add-workspace.jpg)

When creating a new workspace, you’ll:

1. **Name the workspace**.
2. **Add users immediately** (or skip and do this later).
3. **Add personal brands** by following steps 1–4 of this guide.

<Danger>
  **Important:** Remember that the Scripe Extension only supports one LinkedIn account per browser profile. For each personal brand you add, make sure to use a **separate Chrome or Edge profile**, as outlined above.\
  \
  **Alternatively**, have your client install the extension on their own browser so you don’t need to manage multiple profiles yourself.
</Danger>

### Set Up the Company's Knowledge Base

The Company’s Knowledge Base is where you store company-wide knowledge that Scripe can use across **all personal brands** in a workspace.

This ensures everyone’s content stays aligned with your company’s positioning and expertise — while still leaving room for each person’s [**Personal Brand Knowledge Base**](https://scripe.mintlify.app/knowledge/pb-kb) to add their individual voice.

**Basic Set-Up Guide:**

1. Go to your workspace’s overview (where you see all Personal Brands connected).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Company Knowledge.**
3. On the Overview Page, click on `+ New Content Source`
4. For a basic set-up, add the following company-wide content sources:
   - Company website (homepage, product pages, resource hub)
   - Relevant Notion pages
   - Scripe’s ICP Template, available below:

<Tip>
  Use our ICP Questionnaire template to define your Ideal Customer Profile, complete it, and then upload it to the Company Knowledge Base.

  **Get your template in:**

  - [German](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_INzccuwM-ebcP2KZmEBJ1NMomHSYqCIpaqKzhyPReQ/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh4FvXvWrliZ6UmRiF05fwadGEp7-Jkg-_e_82S7H6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

  **Important:** Avoid generic answers (“we target tech companies”). Get really specific.
</Tip>

### Set Up the Company's Tone of Voice

The Workspace Tone of Voice lets you define writing rules that automatically apply to all personal brands in your workspace — ensuring every message sounds aligned and on-brand.

**Basic Set-Up Guide:**

1. Go to your Workspace Overview.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Tone of Voice** under the **Workspace** section.
3. In the **Workspace Guidelines field**, add your company’s tone of voice rules: including both the _Do’s_ and _Don’ts_ for how your team should write.
4. Enable "**Allow Personal Brands to Add Their Own Touch**" so individuals in your workspace can add their own style preferences — but Scripe will always respect your company guidelines first.

**Optional:** Add a workspace-wide footer that automatically appears at the end of every post created within your workspace.
