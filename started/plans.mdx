## Scripe Trial

You can try Scripe for **free.** You are given 14 days to test out our features before making a decision to purchase a plan.

## Starter Plan

The Starter plan is designed for individuals who are just beginning to create content consistently. It includes:

- **1x LinkedIn account:** the number of personal LinkedIn profiles you can connect to Scripe.
- **1x User:** the person who logs into Scripe with their own credentials.
- **1x Workspace:** the main environment where your content, analytics, and settings are organized.

Starter is the best choice if you’re experimenting with LinkedIn content and want to build a simple, steady routine.

<Note>
  Some advanced features such as premium post quality, [weekly personalized post ideas](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered), [content interview](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/interview), [AI-generated images](/sidebar/AI-photos), and team-level tools, are only available on the Professional or Agency plans.

## Professional

The Professional plan is made for founders, freelancers, and small teams who want to manage content more strategically.

You can connect **unlimited LinkedIn accounts and users** within a **single workspace**, making collaboration effortless without per-seat fees. Billing is based on the number of LinkedIn accounts you connect.

Professional includes everything in Starter, plus advanced features like premium post quality, weekly personalized post ideas, team post review, and analytics dashboards. It’s designed to give you both structure and strategy while keeping your workflow simple.

<Tip>
  This plan is perfect if you’re running up to three personal brands — beyond that, the Agency plan will scale more efficiently.

## Agency Plan

The Agency plan is built for consultants, agencies, and companies managing multiple LinkedIn accounts at scale.

It starts with a **minimum of three LinkedIn Accounts** and gets cheaper per account the more you add. With unlimited users and workspaces under one single bill, it simplifies client or multi-brand management.

Agency also includes complete client management tools, reporting dashboards, live workshops, and priority support. If you’re managing several clients, this plan gives you structure, cost efficiency, and direct access to more advanced support.

## Which plan should you choose?

If you’re just starting out, go with **Starter**. If you’re running one to three brands and want more advanced tools, **Professional** is the right fit. If you’re managing three or more accounts and need to scale, **Agency** will give you the best value and flexibility.
