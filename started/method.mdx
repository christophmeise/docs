The [Scripe Method](https://scripe.io/method) is a repeatable content system designed to help professionals and teams show up on LinkedIn in a way that feels consistent, strategic, and human.

Instead of posting randomly or relying on motivation, the method offers a structure that turns content into a habit, backed by data, shaped by real experiences, and tested by thousands of users.

It starts with a simple belief: **people trust people**.

And in a world where most B2B buying decisions begin on social platforms, visibility isn’t just helpful, it’s foundational. But showing up consistently is hard, especially when content feels overwhelming or forced.

That’s where this method steps in: to remove guesswork and guide you through a clear process.

## Content Strategy

Everything starts with direction.

The first step is writing a purpose statement: a short sentence that defines your goal, your audience, and your areas of expertise. From there, you set realistic content goals (like posting once or twice a week) and identify a few core topics you feel confident discussing.

The strategy is then shaped around four [content pillars](/content-strategy/content-formats): educational, personal, organizational, and promotional. These ensure your posts reflect your knowledge, personality, work, and offers. To keep things simple, you’ll use repeatable [content formats](/content-strategy/content-formats) that make planning easier while leaving room for creativity.

## Content Creation

Once your foundation is in place, it’s about showing up consistently. The biggest challenge here is overthinking. The method encourages you to take action, even if it’s through a voice memo or a quick brainstorm with a colleague.

For individuals, Scripe helps define a clear content rhythm and offers format suggestions that match your style and goals. For teams, the method scales through shared goals, personalized strategies, and lightweight collaboration systems like content buddies or editorial check-ins.

**The goal isn’t perfection: it’s consistency.**

With structure and support, content becomes part of your workflow and leads to meaningful results over time.
