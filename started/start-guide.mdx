## Setting up Scripe

Everything in Scripe starts with a [workspace](/account/workspaces). You’ll be asked to:

- Name your workspace
- [Choose your plan](/started/plans) (you can start free)
- Add your [personal brand](/account/personalbrand) or [team members](/team-plan/people)

You can always [invite more people](/team-plan/invite) or upgrade later.

<Info>
  In Scripe, a [Personal Brand](/account/personalbrand) refers to the LinkedIn profile you manage through the platform. You can manage multiple Personal Brands on the Team plan, and a single Personal Brand in the Starter and Professional Plans.

### Step-by-step for individuals:

1. Create your [personal brand](/account/personalbrand), [connect it with LinkedIn](/account/li-connection), and install the [Chrome Extension](/account/chrome).
2. Set up your [content strategy](/content-strategy/content-strategy) (your role, goals, and audience).
3. Add sources to your [Knowledge Base](/sidebar/knowledge) so Scripe can learn more about you.
4. Create your first post:
   - From [audio](/one-post/audio), [text](/one-post/text), or [blank](/one-post/blank).
   - From a [YouTube video](/multiple-posts/youtube), a [long document](/multiple-posts/file), or from a [Content Interview](/multiple-posts/interview).
   - From an [AI-powered Scripe suggestion](/multiple-posts/ai-powered).
5. Use the [Calendar](/sidebar/calendar) view to organize your content and track consistency.
6. Use the [Inspiration page](/sidebar/inspiration) to repurpose posts or follow creators.
   - Scripe subtly adapts your [tone of voice](/sidebar/tov) to match the tone of your followed creators.
7. Check your [Analytics](/sidebar/analytics) tab to learn what works and improve from there.

### Step-by-step for Teams:

1. [Invite teammates](/team-plan/invite) to the team [workspace](/team-plan/workspace).
2. Set up each [member's role](/team-plan/people) within the workspace.
3. [Set up up to 10 personal brands](/team-plan/set-up) and follow the individuals' set up.
4. Understand how to work with the:
   1. [Content Approval Workflow](/team-plan/content-approval)
   2. [Company Calendar](/team-plan/team-calendar)
   3. [Company Analytics](/team-plan/team-analytics)
