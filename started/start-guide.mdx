## Setting up Scripe

Everything in Scripe starts with a [workspace](/account/workspaces). You’ll be asked to:

- Name your workspace
- [Choose your plan](/started/plans) (you can start free)
- Add your [personal brand](/account/personalbrand) or [team members](/team-plan/people)

You can always [invite more people](/team-plan/invite) or upgrade later.

<Info>
  In Scripe, a [Personal Brand](/account/personalbrand) refers to the LinkedIn profile you manage through the platform. You can manage multiple Personal Brands on the Team plan, and a single Personal Brand in the Starter and Professional Plans.
