This guide covers the key terms you'll come across while using Scripe — whether you're just getting started or already building your personal brand.

We’ve included simple explanations for the basics, as well as deeper concepts for those managing multiple personal brands, running teams, or working with LinkedIn as a strategic channel.

## Core Concepts

**Personal Brand: **Your online identity — what you’re known for, especially on LinkedIn. It includes what you say, how you say it, and how consistently you show up.

**Content Strategy: **A custom plan that defines what you post, how often, and for whom. In Scripe, this guides all post ideas and content recommendations.
