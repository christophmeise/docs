Your content in Scripe is only as strong as the knowledge you feed it. Every post, draft, or suggestion generated by Scripe relies on the accuracy and richness of your **Knowledge Base**.

Take time to set up your Knowledge Base carefully. The more complete and well-organized it is, the more Scripe feels like your own content strategist, scaling your voice without losing authenticity.

Your **Knowledge Base** is where you collect and organize all the content that Scripe will use to generate posts in your unique voice. Think of it as your content library: documents, interviews, websites, and quick notes all live here.

The richer your Knowledge Base, the better Scripe can create content for you.

**Scripe offers two types of Knowledge Bases:**

- **Workspace Knowledge Base (Company-wide):** Content uploaded here is applied to ALL personal brands in your workspace. Ideal for brand guidelines, company case studies, or shared playbooks.

<Note>
  The Workspace Knowledge Base is available on Pro and Agency plans. [Learn how to set it up here →](/kb/workspace-kb)
</Note>

- **Personal Brand Knowledge Base (Individual):** Content uploaded here is ONLY used for your brand. Keep all your individual notes, stories, and inputs here for brand-authentic content.

This article covers how to set up your Personal Brand’s Knowledge Base.

## Why It Matters

The better you set up and maintain your Knowledge Base, the more authentic and effective your Scripe-generated content will be.

It ensures:

- Posts rich in context
- Content that’s aligned with your company’s positioning
- A scalable way for teams to create consistent, high-quality content

## Personal vs Company Knowledge

There are two layers of knowledge management in Scripe:

- **Personal Brand Knowledge Base** → Unique to each brand. Best for personal stories, voice rules, individual notes, and content sources tied to one person.
- **Company Knowledge Base** → Shared across all personal brands in your company. Best for product descriptions, sales playbooks, company case studies, and anything that should stay consistent across the team.

This separation ensures that content feels personal while still staying aligned with your company’s positioning.

## One Place for All Your Knowledge

Scripe’s Knowledge Base is your **central library** for all the material you want Scripe to use when creating content.

You can bring everything under one roof:

- **Manual inputs** (quick notes, stories, snippets)
- **Documents** (case studies, decks, playbooks)
- **Websites & Blogs** (company pages, personal blogs, guest articles)
- **External Sources** (Notion pages, YouTube videos, WhatsApp inputs, LinkedIn posts & profile)

## Control and Organization

Each piece of knowledge can be:

- Assigned to a **single Personal Brand** or applied **company-wide**.
- Grouped into **folders and subfolders** to keep everything organized (e.g., _LinkedIn Knowledge_, _Sales Playbook_, _Personal Stories_).
- Automatically synced from tools like Notion and Websites, with Scripe creating dedicated folders for them.

## Always Up to Date

- Websites you connect are automatically re-checked every 7 days to keep data fresh.
- LinkedIn sync includes both new and historical posts, so your full publishing history informs your Knowledge Base.
- WhatsApp inputs are captured instantly, turning quick messages or voice notes into usable knowledge.
