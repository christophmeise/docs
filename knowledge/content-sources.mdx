Your content in Scripe is only as strong as the knowledge you feed it. Every post, draft, or suggestion generated by Scripe relies on the accuracy and richness of your **Knowledge Base**.

**Scripe offers two types of Knowledge Bases:**

- [Company Knowledge Base](/knowledge/workspace-kb): Content uploaded here is applied to ALL personal brands in your workspace. Ideal for brand guidelines, company case studies, or shared playbooks.
- [Personal Brand Knowledge Base](/knowledge/pb-kb): Content uploaded here is ONLY used for your brand. Keep all your individual notes, stories, and inputs here for brand-authentic content.

Take time to set up your Knowledge Base carefully. The more complete and well-organized it is, the more Scripe feels like your own content strategist, scaling your voice without losing authenticity.

## Types of Content Sources in the Knowledge Base

Scripeâ€™s Knowledge Base is your central library for all the material you want Scripe to use when creating content.

To add something to the Knowledge Base, simply click on `+ New Content Source`.

Here are all the types of Content Sources you can add to your Knowledge Base in Scripe:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Text Notes" img="/images/snippets-company.jpg">
    > - Quick, text-only entries that you add manually.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documents" img="/images/documents.jpg">
    > - Upload any file that contains valuable knowledge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Websites" img="/images/websites.jpg">
    Connect public web pages so Scripe can read and use them as knowledge sources.

    ðŸ”„ **Tip:** When you add a top-level URL (like your blog homepage, for example), Scripe pulls in all subpages. You can then choose which ones to connect. If you prefer, you can also add links manually. Links are automatically re-checked every 7 days to keep your Knowledge Base up to date.

    Connect your Notion account and choose the pages you want Scripe to use as knowledge.

    ðŸ”— **Connect your Notion:** To connect Notion to your Knowledge Base, click **Connect Notion** under External Sources. A popup will open for you to log in and grant access. Once connected, you can select which pages to sync, and Scripe will automatically add them as a folder in your Knowledge Base.

### Automatic Sources (Personal Brand Level)

Besides the sources you set up yourself, Scripe also gathers knowledge automatically via:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="WhatsApp Connection">
    Anything you send to Scripe via your WhatsApp connection (messages or voice notes) will be added directly to your Knowledge Base. That way, your quick thoughts and ideas are always captured without extra steps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LinkedIn Profile & Posts">
    Scripe automatically pulls in your LinkedIn profile and posts â€” including posts you made _before_ using Scripe. This ensures your Knowledge Base reflects your full history, not just new content.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  If you havenâ€™t connected your WhatsApp yet, follow this guide to set it up: [How to connect WhatsApp to Scripe â†’](/integrations/whats-app)
</Tip>

## Control and Organization

To keep your Knowledge Base clean and easy to navigate, you can create **folders and subfolders**. This helps you group knowledge by themes or use cases.

<Info>
  **Note:** When you connect Notion or add a Website as a source, Scripe automatically creates a folder for it in your Knowledge Base. This keeps external content organized right from the start.
</Info>

<Info>
  Content added to the Company Knowledge Base in a company-wide setting is visible to all Personal Brands, so we recommend keeping it organized using folders.
</Info>

![Folders Kb Jp](/images/folders-kb.jpg)

From the folder three-dots menu `...` , you can:

- **Rename** â†’ update the folder name
- **Create subfolder** â†’ add a layer of organization under a folder
- **Move to folder** â†’ rearrange items into different folders
- **Delete folder** â†’ remove it when no longer needed

## Always Up to Date

- Websites you connect are automatically re-checked every 7 days to keep data fresh.
- LinkedIn sync includes both new and historical posts, so your full publishing history informs your Knowledge Base.
- WhatsApp inputs are captured instantly, turning quick messages or voice notes into usable knowledge.
