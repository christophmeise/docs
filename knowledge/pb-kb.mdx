Your Personal Brand's Knowledge Base is where you bring **your unique expertises, experiences, and ‘genius zones’** into Scripe. This is what makes content generated by Scripe feel like _you –_ ensuring your content resonates with you and your target audience.

It’s your place to add personal stories, lessons learned, frameworks, and anything else that reflects your career, expertise, and perspective.

## Why the Personal Brand Knowledge Base Matters

- **Authenticity:** Scripe writes posts that reflect your unique background (nobody has the same experience combo like you, let’s show that!)
- **Expert positioning:** Share your niche knowledge and frameworks.
- **Scalable storytelling:** Personal stories and experiences fuel unique content.
- **Alignment with company knowledge:** Scripe blends your personal inputs with the shared Company Knowledge Base.

## Basic Knowledge Base Set-Up:

1. Go to the Personal Brand you want to edit.
2. In the dashboard, on the left sidebar, click **Knowledge Base.**
3. On the Overview Page, click on `+ New Content Source`
4. Add at least two items to complete the basic setup.

  - Use the client’s own language — how do they describe their challenges?
</Tip>

### 3. Automatic Sources

Besides the sources you set up yourself, Scripe also gathers knowledge automatically via:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="WhatsApp Connection">
    Anything you send to Scripe via your WhatsApp connection (messages or voice notes) will be added directly to your Knowledge Base. That way, your quick thoughts and ideas are always captured without extra steps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LinkedIn Profile & Posts">
    Scripe automatically pulls in your LinkedIn profile and posts — including posts you made _before_ using Scripe. This ensures your Knowledge Base reflects your full history, not just new content.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  If you haven’t connected your WhatsApp yet, follow this guide to set it up: [How to connect WhatsApp to Scripe →](/integrations/whats-app)
</Tip>

### 4. Organize Your Content with Folders

To keep your Knowledge Base clean and easy to navigate, you can create **folders and subfolders**. This helps you group knowledge by themes or use cases.

**Suggested folder structure:**

- **Bio & Background**
- **Expertise & Interests**
- **Personal Stories**
- **External Content**

<Info>
  **Note:** When you connect Notion or add a Website as a source, Scripe automatically creates a folder for it in your Knowledge Base. This keeps external content organized right from the start.
</Info>

![Folders Kb Jp](/images/folders-kb.jpg)

From the folder three-dots menu `...` , you can:

- **Rename** → update the folder name
- **Create subfolder** → add a layer of organization under a folder
- **Move to folder** → rearrange items into different folders
- **Delete folder** → remove it when no longer needed
