The Company's Knowledge Base is where you store company-wide knowledge that Scripe can use across **all personal brands** in your workspace.

This ensures everyone’s content stays aligned with your company’s positioning and expertise — while still leaving room for each person’s Personal Brand Knowledge Base to add their individual voice.

<Info>
  The Company Knowledge Base is only available on **Pro & Agency Plans.**
