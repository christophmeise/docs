The Company's Knowledge Base is where you store company-wide knowledge that Scripe can use across **all personal brands** in your workspace.

This ensures everyone’s content stays aligned with your company’s positioning and expertise — while still leaving room for each person’s [Personal Brand Knowledge Base](/knowledge/pb-kb) to add their individual voice.

<Info>
  The Company Knowledge Base is only available on **Pro & Agency Plans.**
</Info>

## Why the Company Knowledge Base Matters

- **Consistency across the team:** Everyone’s content reflects the same positioning and value propositions.
- **Relevance for target audience:** Scripe learns who your ICP is, their challenges, as well as how your company and team solve them.
- **Efficiency:** Centralized resources (case studies, playbooks, decks) are accessible to everyone in your workspace.

## Basic Company Knowledge Base Set-Up:

1. Go to your workspace's overview (where you see all Personal Brands connected).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Company Knowledge.**
3. On the Overview Page, click on `+ New Content Source`
4. For a basic set-up, add the following company-wide content sources:
   - Company website (homepage, product pages, or resource hub)
   - Relevant Notion pages
   - Scripe's ICP Template, available below:

<Tip>
  Use our ICP Questionnaire template to define your Ideal Customer Profile, complete it, and then upload it to the Company Knowledge Base.

  **Important:** Avoid generic answers (“we target tech companies”). Get really specific.
</Tip>

## What to Add to Your Company Knowledge Base

<Note>
  Each content added here can be applied company-wide or assigned to specific Personal Brands, giving you full control over where it’s used.
</Note>

<Info>
  Content added to the Company Knowledge Base in a company-wide setting is visible to all Personal Brands, so we recommend keeping it organized using folders.

### 3. Organize Your Content with Folders

To keep your Knowledge Base clean and easy to navigate, you can create **folders and subfolders**. This helps you group knowledge by themes or use cases.

**Suggested folder structure:**

- Core Positioning
- Product & Value Proposition
- Target Persona & Problem-Solution Knowledge
- Strategic Guidance

<Info>
  **Note:** When you connect Notion or add a Website as a source, Scripe automatically creates a folder for it in your Knowledge Base. This keeps external content organized right from the start.
</Info>

<Info>
  Content added to the Company Knowledge Base in a company-wide setting is visible to all Personal Brands, so we recommend keeping it organized using folders.
