The Company's Knowledge Base is where you store company-wide knowledge that Scripe can use across **all personal brands** in your workspace.

This ensures everyone’s content stays aligned with your company’s positioning and expertise — while still leaving room for each person’s Personal Brand Knowledge Base to add their individual voice.

<Info>
  The Company Knowledge Base is only available on **Pro & Agency Plans.**

## How to set up your Company's Knowledge Base

### 1. Go to Your Knowledge Base

- Go to your workspace's overview (where you see all Personal Brands connected).
- On the left sidebar, click **Company Knowledge.**

### 2. Set Up your Sources

You can connect the same types of sources as for a Personal Brand. The difference is that everything you add here becomes **shared knowledge** for **all personal brands** in your workspace.

That means this is the place for **company-wide inputs** — content that should guide everyone’s messaging and keep it consistent.

You can add sources by clicking on the `+ New Content` button on the top right side.

<Tip>
  Each content added here can be applied company-wide or assigned to specific Personal Brands, giving you full control over where it’s used.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Content added to the Company Knowledge Base in a company-wide setting is visible to all Personal Brands, so we recommend keeping it organized using folders.
</Info>

**Here’s what each option means — and what’s best to add:**

### 3. Organize Your Content with Folders

To keep your Knowledge Base clean and easy to navigate, you can create **folders and subfolders**. This helps you group knowledge by themes or use cases.

**💡 Examples of folder structures:**

- **Sales Playbook** → outbound workflow, client case studies
- **Personal Stories** → founder journey, lessons learned, anecdotes

<Info>
  **Note:** When you connect Notion or add a Website as a source, Scripe automatically creates a folder for it in your Knowledge Base. This keeps external content organized right from the start.
</Info>

<Info>
  Content added to the Company Knowledge Base in a company-wide setting is visible to all Personal Brands, so we recommend keeping it organized using folders.
</Info>

From the folder three-dots menu `...` , you can:

- **Rename** → update the folder name
