Your **Knowledge Base** is where you collect and organize all the content that Scripe will use to generate posts in your unique voice. Think of it as your content library: documents, interviews, websites, and quick notes all live here.

The richer your Knowledge Base, the better Scripe can create content for you.

**Scripe offers two types of Knowledge Bases:**

- **Workspace Knowledge Base (Company-wide):** Content uploaded here is applied to ALL personal brands in your workspace. Ideal for brand guidelines, company case studies, or shared playbooks.

<Note>
  The Workspace Knowledge Base is available on Pro and Agency plans. [Learn how to set it up here →](/kb/workspace-kb)
</Note>

- **Personal Brand Knowledge Base (Individual):** Content uploaded here is ONLY used for your brand. Keep all your individual notes, stories, and inputs here for brand-authentic content.

This article covers how to set up your Personal Brand’s Knowledge Base.

## How to Set Up Your Personal Brand Knowledge Base

### 1. Go to Your Knowledge Base

- Go to the Personal Brand you want to edit.
- In the dashboard, on the left sidebar, click **Knowledge Base.**

### 2. Set Up your Sources

Your Personal Brand Knowledge Base can pull from many different types of sources. Whatever you add here, will be used as context to make better content and sound more like you.

You can add sources by clicking on the `+ New Content` button on the top right side.

**Here’s what each option means — and what’s best to add:**

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Snippets" icon="note-sticky">
    Quick, text-only entries that you add manually. 

    **💡 Use for:**

    - Raw thoughts, lessons learned, or personal stories
    - Copy/paste insights from ChatGPT or other drafts
    - Voice/tone guidelines (e.g., words you always/never use)

    **📝 Example:**

    > _“When I started my agency, I only had €500 and no clients. I want to highlight this story in my content to show how resourcefulness beats big budgets.”_
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documents" icon="paperclip">
    Upload any file that contains valuable knowledge or content you’ve created. Scripe will read and extract the text, making it available for your content generation.

    **💡 Use for:**

    - Client case studies saved as PDFs
    - Sales decks or training presentations
    - Internal playbooks or strategy docs
    - Whitepapers, research, or long reports

    **📝 Example:**\
    Upload a PDF of a detailed client success story that showcases your process and results.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Websites" icon="laptop-mobile">
    Connect public web pages so Scripe can read and use them as knowledge sources. Great for anything you’ve already published online.

    **💡 Use for:**

    - Blog posts or articles
      - Press features or interviews about you
    - FAQ or About Me pages
    - 

    **📝 Example:**\
    Connect your Medium profile so Scripe can turn past blog posts into fresh LinkedIn content, or add a guest article you wrote on an industry publication. 

    🔄 **Tip:** When you add a homepage (like your blog or Medium profile), Scripe pulls in all subpages. You can then choose which ones to connect. If you prefer, you can also add links manually. Links are automatically re-checked every 7 days to keep your Knowledge Base up to date.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notion" icon="folders">
    - Connect your Notion account and choose the pages you want Scripe to use as knowledge. Perfect if you already use Notion to store notes, drafts, or playbooks.

    **💡 Use for:**

    - Workflow breakdowns or step-by-step processes
    - Meeting notes or strategy docs
    - Frameworks and templates you’ve built
    - 

    **📝 Example:**\
    Connect your Notion workspace and select your “Outbound Workflow” page, for example. Scripe can then turn your playbook into LinkedIn posts that showcase your expertise.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Youtube Videos" icon="circle-video">
    Add links to your YouTube videos and Scripe will automatically pull the transcript to use as knowledge. Great for capturing your spoken content without extra work.

    **💡 Use for:**

    - Webinars or online workshops you’ve hosted
    - Guest appearances on podcasts
    - Keynotes, conference talks, or panel discussions
    - Video tutorials or how-to guides you’ve recorded

    **📝 Example:**

    Paste the link to a podcast episode where you shared your founder journey, or a keynote talk you gave at a sales conference, or even a tutorial you recorded using LinkedIn automation tools.
  </Card>

### 3. Automatic Sources

Besides the sources you set up yourself, Scripe also gathers knowledge automatically via:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="WhatsApp Connection">
    Anything you send to Scripe via your WhatsApp connection (messages or voice notes) will be added directly to your Knowledge Base. That way, your quick thoughts and ideas are always captured without extra steps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LinkedIn Profile & Posts">
    Scripe automatically pulls in your LinkedIn profile and posts — including posts you made _before_ using Scripe. This ensures your Knowledge Base reflects your full history, not just new content.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  If you haven’t connected your WhatsApp yet, follow this guide to set it up: [How to connect WhatsApp to Scripe →](/integrations/whats-app)
</Tip>

### 4. Organize Your Content with Folders

To keep your Knowledge Base clean and easy to navigate, you can create **folders and subfolders**. This helps you group knowledge by themes or use cases.

**💡 Examples of folder structures:**

- **Sales Playbook** → outbound workflow, client case studies
- **Personal Stories** → founder journey, lessons learned, anecdotes

From the folder three-dots menu `...` , you can:

- **Rename** → update the folder name
- **Create subfolder** → add a layer of organization under a folder
- **Move to folder** → rearrange items into different folders
- **Delete folder** → remove it when no longer needed
