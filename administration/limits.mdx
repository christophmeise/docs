Scripe helps you create content faster, and with your subscription, you get generous monthly limits to support consistent output.

## What’s Included Each Month

- 🎧 **12 hours of podcast/audio transcriptions**\
  Use this across voice memos, uploaded files, or YouTube videos. Perfect for repurposing long-form content into multiple LinkedIn posts.
- ✍️ **200 posts generated**\
  This includes all content created through text input, voice, content interviews, file uploads, and carousels.

These limits reset **monthly** based on your billing cycle.

<Tip>
  Make the most of your usage by repurposing audio into multiple posts or turning longer interviews into content series.
