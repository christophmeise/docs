Scripe helps you create content faster, and with your subscription, you get generous monthly limits to support consistent output.

## What‚Äôs Included Each Month

- üéß **12 hours of podcast/audio transcriptions**\
  Use this across voice memos, uploaded files, or YouTube videos. Perfect for repurposing long-form content into multiple LinkedIn posts.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **200 posts generated**\
  This includes all content created through text input, voice, content interviews, file uploads, and carousels.

These limits reset **monthly** based on your billing cycle.

### Difference between Normal Posts and AI-Powered Suggestions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Normal Posts" icon="message-pen">
    **(available in the Starter and Pro plans)**

    These are posts generated by Scripe based on an input you provide, [such as a PDF](/multiple-posts/file), [YouTube link](/multiple-posts/youtube), [article](/multiple-posts/file), [voice note](/one-post/audio), or [raw text](/one-post/text). Scripe turns that content into a ready-to-edit LinkedIn post. 

    You can generate **unlimited** normal posts in both plans.

  <Card title="AI-Powered Suggestions" icon="sparkles">
    **(exclusive to the Pro plan)**

    These posts don‚Äôt require you to upload or input anything. Instead, Scripe‚Äôs AI Agent takes [everything it knows about your brand](/sidebar/knowledge) and [suggests original post ideas](/multiple-posts/ai-powered) for you every week. 

    It‚Äôs like having a personal content strategist who‚Äôs always thinking ahead.

<Tip>
  Make the most of your usage by repurposing audio into multiple posts or turning longer interviews into content series. [Learn more here ‚Üí](/multiple-posts/file)
