### Step 2: Use Your Free Trial Credits

- You’ll receive free credits that allow you to generate up to 3 posts.
- These can be used before entering any payment details.
- Once you run out of free credits, you’ll need to select a plan to continue.

<Info>
  Alternatively, you can skip the free credits and go directly to [Billing](/administration/billing) inside your Settings.

### Step 3: Choose a Plan

- When your free trial ends, click on “Upgrade Now” to see the available plans.
- If you're managing an organization, you’ll also see organization-level billing options.

### Step 4: Apply Your Promo Code

2. Enter your promo code in the field provided before completing the payment process.

<Note>
  Promo codes for free months only apply to monthly plans. If you're viewing the **yearly plan**, switch by selecting **“Pay Monthly”.**
