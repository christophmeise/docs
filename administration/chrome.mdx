The **Scripe Extension** is an essential tool that connects your LinkedIn profile with Scripe. It allows Scripe to retrieve analytics data, access your past posts, and keep your account activity updated, ensuring you get the full value from the platform.

## What the Scripe Extension Does

- Connects your LinkedIn profile to your Scripe workspace.
- Retrieves analytics from your LinkedIn posts.
- Scrapes your previously published LinkedIn posts to populate your Scripe dashboard and train your tone of voice.
- Keeps your analytics and post history updated automatically.
- Allows for the scheduling of posts on LinkedIn.

<Info>
  The extension **does not** perform any other actions on your LinkedIn account.

## Requirements for Proper Functionality

To ensure Scripe works properly:

- The extension **must be installed** in your **Chrome or Edge browser.**
- You must be logged into your LinkedIn account on the same browser where the extension is installed.

Without the extension or an active LinkedIn session, Scripe will not be able to retrieve data or update your account correctly.

<Note>
  Only ONE LinkedIn account can be linked to the Scripe Extension. Follow the instructions below if you manage more than one Personal Brand.
</Note>

## Managing Multiple Personal Brands

If you manage **multiple Personal Brands** within Scripe (i.e., on a Pro or Agency Plan), special care is needed:

- Each LinkedIn profile must be linked to a **separate browser profile**.
- This prevents conflicts between sessions and ensures the extension correctly syncs with the intended LinkedIn account.

<Info>
  **Why?** Because the extension automatically reads the LinkedIn profile you're logged into. If multiple LinkedIn profiles are managed in the same browser profile, it can cause errors or sync issues.

  You can simply create a new Chrome Profile without setting up a new Google account. 

  Here's how:

  <Tip>
    **Tip:** Name your Profile with a reference to your client.

Alternatively, have your client install the extension on their own browser so you don’t need to manage multiple profiles yourself.

### Override the data of the Scripe Extension

If the Scripe Extension accidentally synced the wrong account with your Personal Brand, you can fix it by going to your **Profile Settings**, selecting your **Personal Brand**, and clicking on **“Override Personal Brand”** to update the data.
