Scripe needs your LinkedIn connection for **publishing and scheduling**.

✅ With the LinkedIn connection:\
You can schedule posts and let Scripe publish them automatically.

❌ Without the LinkedIn connection:\
You’ll need to manually copy and paste the content into LinkedIn.

## How to Connect Your LinkedIn

In case you have not connected your LinkedIn during onboarding, you can connect it anytime in two simple ways:

### ✅ Option 1: From Your Dashboard

- On your Scripe dashboard, click the **“Connect LinkedIn” badge**
- This will prompt you to connect your LinkedIn account
- Once connected, the badge will state **Connected**, indicating the connection is active
