If you offer **done-for-you** services and want to set up Scripe on behalf of your clients (instead of having them do it themselves), here’s how to make it work smoothly.

## 1. Two Ways to Manage Client Accounts

### **Option 1: Client installs the Chrome extension** (recommended)

- Easiest option — no switching profiles required.
- You create their workspace, add their personal brand, and send them the Chrome extension link.
- They install it while logged into their LinkedIn account.
- From then on, analytics sync automatically whenever they open LinkedIn.

### **Option 2: You manage it from your computer using Chrome profiles**

- Create a **separate Chrome profile** for each client.
- Install the Scripe Chrome extension in that profile.
- Log into the client’s LinkedIn account in that profile.
- To sync analytics, open LinkedIn from that profile (no need to open Scripe).

## 2. Initial Setup Steps

1. **Create a workspace** for your client so you can invite them if needed.
2. **Add a personal brand** for the client.
3. When prompted, **install the Scripe Chrome extension**.
4. If you’re setting it up yourself, make sure you’re logged into the client’s LinkedIn account first.

## 3. Sending the Chrome Extension Link to the Client

If your client is installing the extension themselves:

1. Go to the Chrome extensions menu (three dots → Extensions → Scripe).
2. Copy the Scripe extension link.
3. Send it to the client.
4. Once they install it and are logged into LinkedIn, analytics will sync automatically in the background.

## 4. Keeping Analytics Updated

- **If the client installed the Chrome extension**: They just need to open LinkedIn normally — analytics will update automatically.
- **If you’re managing it via Chrome profile**: Open LinkedIn in the client’s profile periodically to trigger syncing.
