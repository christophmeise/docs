A **DFY (Done-For-You) offer** is a service model where you handle **everything on behalf of the client**. Instead of guiding or collaborating (like DWY), you fully take over the execution.

It usually looks like this:

- You own the client‚Äôs setup, the content creation, and publishing.
- The client only provides input, approvals, or goals.
- You manage Scripe under your Pro or Agency account. You take over the Scripe subscription fees, integrating the cost into what you bill your client.

Here's how to collaborate in Scripe on a DFY offer:

## DFY Scripe Set-Up

Before working with a client, we recommend that you:

1. **Get familiar with Scripe** ‚Äì follow this [step-by-step guide](/started/easy-set-up) to set up your own workspace and learn the platform inside out.
2. [Join our Partner Office Hours](https://lu.ma/scripe?k=c) ‚Äì bring questions, learn best practices, and get support on how to run DFY offers successfully with Scripe.

<Tip>
  **Prefer a faster track?** You can also [book a paid setup sprint](https://calendly.com/eva-erm/scripe-implementation), where we‚Äôll get everything ready for you.
</Tip>

### 1. Choose your Client Set-Up

There are two main ways to manage Client Accounts in Scripe:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Client Installs the Chrome Extension" icon="circle-user">
    - Easiest option ‚Äî no switching profiles required.
    - You create their workspace, add their personal brand, and send them the Chrome extension link.
    - They install it while logged into their LinkedIn account.
    - From then on, analytics sync automatically whenever they open LinkedIn.
  </Card>
  <Card title="You manage it via different Profiles" icon="screen-users">
    Create a **separate Chrome profile** for each client.

    Install the Scripe Chrome extension in that profile.

    Log into the client‚Äôs LinkedIn account in that profile.

    To sync analytics, open LinkedIn from that profile (no need to open Scripe).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**What to send to your client in each scenario:**

### 2. Scripe Setup Checklist

<Note>
  If you have any questions along the way, you can always refer to the [step-by-step setup guide](/started/easy-set-up) for help.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workspace for your client so you can invite them if needed.">
    To manage or create new workspaces, open the menu by clicking on your workspace name in the top left corner and select **Switch workspace**. There, you‚Äôll see a list of all your workspaces and the option to **Add Workspace**.

    ![Add Workspace Jp](/images/add-workspace.jpg)

    When creating a new workspace, you‚Äôll:

    1. **Name the workspace**.
    2. **Add users immediately** (or skip and do this later).

    <Tip>
      If multiple people from one company work together, keep them in the **same workspace**. \
      \
      If you manage completely different companies (which shouldn‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs data), create **separate workspaces**.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add and Set Up the Personal Brand(s) for your client.">
    To add a new personal brand to your current workspace, click **Add Personal Brand**. You‚Äôll then go through the same onboarding steps as you did during the initial setup of your account:

    - Install the Scripe Extension (you or the client)
    - Finish Product Onboarding (theme, language, etc)
    - Dashboard Set Up (connect LI account, create content strategy, upload min. 2 files to the Knowledge Base)

    <Tip>
      Want to give even more value to your client? Use our ICP Questionnaire template to define their ICP, fill it out together, and then upload it to the Knowledge Base.

      **Get your template in:**

      - [German](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_INzccuwM-ebcP2KZmEBJ1NMomHSYqCIpaqKzhyPReQ/edit?usp=sharing)
      - [English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh4FvXvWrliZ6UmRiF05fwadGEp7-Jkg-_e_82S7H6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

      **Best practices to fill it out:**

      - Avoid generic answers (‚Äúwe target tech companies‚Äù). Get really specific.
      - Use the client‚Äôs own language ‚Äî how do they describe their challenges?
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite Members to the workspace.">
    1. Go to your **Settings**.
    2. Navigate to the [People](/professional/invite) tab.
    3. In the Members section, click on the **Invitations** tab.
    4. Click **Invite** in the top-right corner.
    5. Enter the user‚Äôs email and [assign a role](/team-plan/people).
       - **Admin** ‚Äì Full access to everything: settings, profiles, analytics, publishing.
       - **Team Manager** ‚Äì Access to all personal brands and analytics, but no publishing.
       - **Content Assistant** ‚Äì Supports one personal brand only, with limited access.
       - **Personal Brand** ‚Äì Access is limited to their own Personal Brand dashboard.
       - **Personal Brand + Team Insights** ‚Äì Own PB dashboard plus team analytics and calendar.
       - **Client** ‚Äì Basic access to Posts, Calendar, and Analytics only.
    6. Send the invite.

    ![People Jp](/images/people.jpg)

    **Once the invite is accepted, assign the member to their Personal Brand(s):**

    1. Go to the **Assign users to projects** section (just below the members list).
    2. For each user, choose which Personal Brand(s) they should have access to.
    3. You can assign multiple users to the same brand, or assign one user to several brands.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep Analytics Updated">
    - **If the client installed the Extension:** They just need to open LinkedIn normally and analytics will update automatically.
    - **If you‚Äôre managing it via Chrome profile:** Open LinkedIn in the client‚Äôs profile periodically to trigger syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Onboard your client to Scripe

- Invite your client to a Scripe Onboarding Call.
- Meet in the call and guide the client through the Scripe Platform.

**Checklist for your Scripe Intro Calls with Clients:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure Scripe Extension is installed & the LinkedIn account is connected.">
    Both badges on the Scripe dashboard need to show as **green**:

    - **Analytics badge** confirms that the [Chrome/Edge extension](/administration/chrome) is installed.
    - **Scheduling badge** confirms the client‚Äôs [LinkedIn account is connected](/administration/li-connection).

    <Warning>
      When you assign your client the **Client role**, their access is limited to **Posts, Calendar, and Analytics**. They won‚Äôt see the dashboard ‚Äî so only you can verify that everything is set up correctly.

      \
      In this scenario, you should always keep your client‚Äôs LinkedIn login credentials to ensure the connection remains active.
    </Warning>
    Note that the LinkedIn connection may occasionally expire; Scripe will flag this on the **Personal Brand dashboard**, prompting you to refresh it when needed.

    ![Li Connection Jp](/images/li-connection.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explain the Content Strategy and give guidance if needed.">
    Explain to the client that the [content strategy settings](https://scripe.mintlify.app/content-strategy/content-strategy) define what types of posts will be published, how often, and who they're trying to reach.

    It allows you (and Scripe) to recommend the best post formats for their goals and measure content performance in a way that actually makes sense to reach these goals.

    <Warning>
      When you assign your client the **Client role**, they won‚Äôt see the Content Strategy. So you can skip this step or present it differently.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get assets from your client to the Knowledge Base.">
    When meeting with your client, explain that you‚Äôll need as many **relevant input materials as possible** to fully understand their business and create tailored content.

    Use the call to gather assets such as:

    - Sales decks or one-pagers
    - Case studies or success stories
    - Website copy, landing pages, or blog posts
    - ICP or persona descriptions
    - Recorded calls, webinars, or podcasts

    To go deeper, we recommend using our **ICP Questionnaire template**. Fill it out together with your client during the meeting, then upload it to the Knowledge Base.

    <Tip>
      **Get your ICP Questionnaire template in:**

      - [German](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_INzccuwM-ebcP2KZmEBJ1NMomHSYqCIpaqKzhyPReQ/edit?usp=sharing)
      - [English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh4FvXvWrliZ6UmRiF05fwadGEp7-Jkg-_e_82S7H6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

      **Best practices to fill it out:**

      - Avoid generic answers (‚Äúwe target tech companies‚Äù). Get really specific.
      - Use the client‚Äôs own language ‚Äî how do they describe their challenges?
    </Tip>
    Once all materials are uploaded, Scripe will begin generating [weekly AI-powered Content Suggestions](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered) (done-for-you post ideas).

    <Warning>
      When you assign your client the **Client role**, they won‚Äôt see the Knowledge Base. You are responsible for collecting and uploading everything on your side.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Walk the Client through their Scripe account.">
    If your client has the **Client role**, walk them through the parts of Scripe they can access:

    **Posts tab** ‚Üí Explain the different views:

    - **Review:** Posts awaiting their feedback. Show them how to approve or reject each one.

    ![Approval 2 Jp](/images/approval-2.jpg)

    - **Scheduled:** all posts that are lined up and scheduled to publish.
    - **Published:** a record of all posts that have already gone live (including all existing posts published on their LinkedIn even before Scripe).

    **Calendar tab**

    - Show them how to add **content notes** directly to the calendar.
    - Switch between **monthly and weekly view** so they can track upcoming posts more easily.

    **Analytics tab**

    - Finally, guide them through the Analytics Dashboard. Highlight that this is where they‚Äôll see the impact of all the content you‚Äôre creating and managing for them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Guide the client to connect Scripe with their WhatsApp" stepNumber={5}>
    Guide your client to install the [WhatsApp integration](/integrations/whats-app) to instantly send ideas or content snippets straight into Scripe whenever inspiration strikes.

    To install the WhatsApp integration, you can guide your client like this:

    1. Go to your **Settings** in Scripe and click on the **Personal Brand** you want to connect.
    2. Under **WhatsApp Connections**, click **Add Connection**.
    3. A QR code will appear.
    4. Scan the QR code with your phone to connect.
  </Step>
</Steps>
