A **DFY (Done-For-You) offer** is a service model where you handle **everything on behalf of the client**. Instead of guiding or collaborating (like DWY), you fully take over the execution.

It usually looks like this:

- You own the client’s setup, the content creation, and publishing.
- The client only provides input, approvals, or goals.
- You manage Scripe under your Pro or Agency account. You take over the Scripe subscription fees, integrating the cost into what you bill your client.

Here's how to collaborate in Scripe on a DFY offer:

## DFY Scripe Set-Up

Before working with a client, we recommend that you:

1. **Get familiar with Scripe** – follow this [step-by-step guide](/started/easy-set-up) to set up your own workspace and learn the platform inside out.
2. [Join our Partner Office Hours](https://lu.ma/scripe?k=c) – bring questions, learn best practices, and get support on how to run DFY offers successfully with Scripe.

<Tip>
  **Prefer a faster track?** You can also [book a paid setup sprint](https://calendly.com/eva-erm/scripe-implementation), where we’ll get everything ready for you.
</Tip>

### 1. Choose your Client Set-Up

There are two main ways to manage Client Accounts in Scripe:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Client Installs the Chrome Extension" icon="circle-user">
    - Easiest option — no switching profiles required.
    - You create their workspace, add their personal brand, and send them the Chrome extension link.
    - They install it while logged into their LinkedIn account.
    - From then on, analytics sync automatically whenever they open LinkedIn.
  </Card>
  <Card title="You manage it via different Profiles" icon="screen-users">
    - Create a **separate Chrome profile** for each client.
    - Install the Scripe Chrome extension in that profile.
    - Log into the client’s LinkedIn account in that profile.
    - To sync analytics, open LinkedIn from that profile (no need to open Scripe).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**What to send to your client in each scenario:**

### 2. Scripe Setup Checklist

<Note>
  If you have any questions along the way, you can always refer to the [step-by-step setup guide](/started/easy-set-up) for help.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workspace for your client so you can invite them if needed.">
    To manage or create new workspaces, open the menu by clicking on your workspace name in the top left corner and select **Switch workspace**. There, you’ll see a list of all your workspaces and the option to **Add Workspace**.

    ![Change Workspace](/images/change-workspace.jpg)

    When creating a new workspace, you’ll:

    1. **Name the workspace**.
    2. **Add users immediately** (or skip and do this later).

    <Tip>
      If multiple people from one company work together, keep them in the **same workspace**. \
      \
      If you manage completely different companies (which shouldn’t see each other’s data), create **separate workspaces**.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add and Set Up the Personal Brand(s) for your client.">
    To add a new personal brand to your current workspace, click **Add Personal Brand**. You’ll then go through the same onboarding steps as you did during the initial setup of your account:

    - Install the Scripe Extension (you or the client)
    - Finish Product Onboarding (theme, language, etc)
    - Personalisation Set Up (create Content Strategy, upload min. 2 files to the Knowledge Base and set up Tone of Voice)

    <Tip>
      Want to give even more value to your client? Use our ICP Questionnaire template to define their ICP, fill it out together, and then upload it to the Knowledge Base.

      **Get your template in:**

      - [German](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_INzccuwM-ebcP2KZmEBJ1NMomHSYqCIpaqKzhyPReQ/edit?usp=sharing)
      - [English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh4FvXvWrliZ6UmRiF05fwadGEp7-Jkg-_e_82S7H6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

      **Best practices to fill it out:**

      - Avoid generic answers (“we target tech companies”). Get really specific.
      - Use the client’s own language — how do they describe their challenges?
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite Members to the workspace.">
    To invite members to your workspace, open the menu by clicking on your workspace name in the top left corner and select **Invite Members.**

    ![Invite Members](/images/invite-members.jpg)

    1. Enter the user’s email, choose which Personal Brand(s) they should have access to, and [assign a role](/team-plan/people):
       - **Admin** – Full access to everything: settings, profiles, analytics, publishing.
       - **Team Manager** – Access to all personal brands and analytics, but no publishing.
       - **Content Assistant** – Supports one personal brand only, with limited access.
       - **Personal Brand** – Access is limited to their own Personal Brand dashboard.
       - **Personal Brand + Team Insights** – Own PB dashboard plus team analytics and calendar.
       - **Client** – Basic access to Posts, Calendar, and Analytics only.
    6. Send the invite.

    <Tip>
      You can always manage all invitations, members and roles in the Workspace Settings → People.
    </Tip>
    <Info>
      You can assign multiple users to the same brand, or assign one user to several brands.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep Analytics Updated">
    - **If the client installed the Extension:** They just need to open LinkedIn normally and analytics will update automatically.
    - **If you’re managing it via Chrome profile:** Open LinkedIn in the client’s profile periodically to trigger syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Onboard your client to Scripe

- Invite your client to a Scripe Onboarding Call.
- Meet in the call and guide the client through the Scripe Platform.

<Warning>
  When you assign your client the **Client role**, their access is limited to **Posts, Calendar, and Analytics**. They won’t see anything else, so only you can verify that everything is set up correctly.
</Warning>

**Checklist for your Scripe Intro Calls with Clients:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Walk the Client through their Scripe account." stepNumber={1}>
    If your client has the **Client role**, walk them through the parts of Scripe they can access:

    - **Inbox** → This is where they receive notifications to review or approve posts.

    <Tip>
      Tip: Assign a post to them before the call so you can show a real approval flow.
    </Tip>
    - **Posts tab** → Explain the different post statuses and how content moves through the workflow during your collaboration.
    - **Calendar tab** → This gives them a clear overview of when posts are scheduled to go live.
    - **Analytics tab **→ Highlight that this is where they’ll see the impact of all the content you’re creating and managing for them.

    <Info>
      **Important:** If you assign your client a role other than **Client**, they’ll have full access to view and edit all posts.
    </Info>
    This helps the client understand exactly where they’re involved, what they’re responsible for, and how visibility is maintained throughout the process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Guide the client to connect Scripe with their WhatsApp" stepNumber={5}>
    Guide your client to install the [WhatsApp integration](/integrations/whats-app) to instantly send ideas or content snippets straight into Scripe whenever inspiration strikes.

    To install the WhatsApp integration, you can guide your client like this:

    1. Go to your **Settings** in Scripe and click on the **Personal Brand** you want to connect.
    2. Under **WhatsApp Connections**, click **Add Connection**.
    3. A QR code will appear.
    4. Scan the QR code with your phone to connect.
  </Step>
</Steps>
