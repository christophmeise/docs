If you offer **done-for-you** services and want to set up Scripe on behalf of your clients (instead of having them do it themselves), here’s how to make it work smoothly.

## Two Ways to Manage Client Accounts

<Card title="Client installs the Chrome Extension" icon="user">
  - Easiest option — no switching profiles required.
  - You create their workspace, add their personal brand, and send them the Chrome extension link ([available here](/account/chrome)).
  - They install it while logged into their LinkedIn account.
  - From then on, analytics sync automatically whenever they open LinkedIn.

<Card title="You manage via different Chrome Profiles" icon="screen-users">
  - Create a **separate Chrome profile** for each client.
  - Install the Scripe Chrome extension in that profile.
  - Log into the client’s LinkedIn account in that profile.
  - To sync analytics, open LinkedIn from that profile (no need to open Scripe).
</Card>

## Initial Setup Steps

1. **Create a workspace** for your client so you can invite them if needed.
2. **Add a personal brand** for the client.
3. When prompted, **install the Scripe Chrome extension**.
4. If you’re setting it up yourself, make sure you’re logged into the client’s LinkedIn account first.

## Keeping Analytics Updated

- **If the client installed the Chrome extension**: They just need to open LinkedIn normally and analytics will update automatically.
- **If you’re managing it via Chrome profile**: Open LinkedIn in the client’s profile periodically to trigger syncing.
