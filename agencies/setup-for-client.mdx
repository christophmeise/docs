A **DFY (Done-For-You) offer** is a service model where you handle **everything on behalf of the client**. Instead of guiding or collaborating (like DWY), you fully take over the execution.

It usually looks like this:

- You own the clientâ€™s setup, content creation, and publishing.
- The client only provides input, approvals, or goals.
- You manage Scripe under your Pro or Agency account. You take over the Scripe subscription fees, integrating the cost into what you bill your client.

Here's how to collaborate in Scripe on a DFY offer:

## DFY Scripe Set-Up

Before working with a client, we recommend that you:

1. **Get familiar with Scripe** â€“ follow this [step-by-step guide](/started/easy-set-up) to set up your own workspace and learn the platform inside out.
2. [Join our Partner Office Hours](https://lu.ma/scripe?k=c) â€“ bring questions, learn best practices, and get support on how to run DWY offers successfully with Scripe.

### 1. Choose your Client Set-Up

There are two main ways to manage Client Accounts in Scripe:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Client Installs the Chrome Extension" icon="circle-user">
    - Easiest option â€” no switching profiles required.
    - You create their workspace, add their personal brand, and send them the Chrome extension link.
    - They install it while logged into their LinkedIn account.
    - From then on, analytics sync automatically whenever they open LinkedIn.
  </Card>
  <Card title="You manage via different Profiles" icon="screen-users">
    Create a **separate Chrome profile** for each client.

    Install the Scripe Chrome extension in that profile.

    Log into the clientâ€™s LinkedIn account in that profile.

    To sync analytics, open LinkedIn from that profile (no need to open Scripe).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**What to send to your client in each scenario:**

### 2. Scripe Setup Checklist

<Note>
  If you have any questions along the way, you can always refer to the [step-by-step setup guide](/started/easy-set-up) for help.
</Note>

1. [Create a new workspace](https://scripe.mintlify.app/started/easy-set-up#create-different-workspaces-for-different-clients) for your client so you can invite them if needed.
2. [Add the Personal Brand(s)](https://scripe.mintlify.app/started/easy-set-up#add-more-personal-brands-to-your-workspace) for your client.
   - Set up the Personal Brand(s) for your client ([follow steps 1-4 here](/started/easy-set-up)).
   - Install the Scripe Extension, ensuring it's connected to the LI account of your client.
     - Skip the Chrome Extension if you are not logged into your clientâ€™s LI account or if the client is installing it.
3. [Invite Members](https://scripe.mintlify.app/started/easy-set-up#invite-members-to-your-workspace) to the workspace.
   - Ensure all users have the correct role with according rights.
4. Keep Analytics Updated:
   - **If the client installed the Extension:** They just need to open LinkedIn normally and analytics will update automatically.
   - **If youâ€™re managing it via Chrome profile:** Open LinkedIn in the clientâ€™s profile periodically to trigger syncing.

### 3. Onboard your client to Scripe
