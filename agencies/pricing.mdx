## 1. Workspaces: Your Collaboration Hub

- To collaborate with other people in Scripe, you need a **workspace**. Personal accounts (created during onboarding without selecting ‚Äúworkspace‚Äù) can‚Äôt invite other people.
- **Every workspace has its own subscription**, even if you manage multiple.

<Tip>
  If multiple people from one company work together, keep them in the **same workspace**.\
  If you manage completely different companies (who shouldn‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs data), create **separate workspaces**.
</Tip>

üëâ If you're setting up Scripe for a client and you're paying for the subscription, [read this tutorial](/agencies/setup-for-client).

üëâ If your client is paying for Scripe, then they need to invite you to collaborate on their workspace. In this case, [read this tutorial](/agencies/client-setup).

## 2. Personal Brands & Pricing

- Inside each workspace, you can have **multiple personal brands**.
- **A personal brand = one connected LinkedIn account**.
- **Billing is per LinkedIn account**, not per user.
- You can invite **unlimited users** to a workspace at no extra cost.

<Note>
  If you manage 5 LinkedIn profiles for one company, you‚Äôll have 1 workspace with 5 personal brands, and pay for 5 LinkedIn accounts.
</Note>

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

When inviting someone to a workspace, you can [assign roles](/team-plan/people):

- **Team Manager** ‚Äì Comprehensive access to all profiles, analytics, and dashboard functions. Cannot publish content, maintaining a focus on management and strategy oversight.
- **Content Assistant** ‚Äì Limited to managing and supporting a single personal brand profile. Does not have access to other team profiles or organizational data, ensuring privacy and focus.
- **Personal Brand** ‚Äì Restricted to their own profile and data only. Ideal for individuals managing their personal brand without access to other team profiles or insights.
- **Personal Brand with Team Insights** ‚Äì Access to own personal brand, plus the team analytics dashboard and team calendar. No access to other members‚Äô brands, settings, or billing.
