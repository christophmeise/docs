A **corporate influencer program** is when companies empower their employees to build personal brands on LinkedIn. Instead of relying only on the company page, selected employees share authentic posts under their own profiles — building trust, expanding reach, and driving new business opportunities.

For employees, this means more visibility, thought leadership, and career growth. For companies, it creates stronger employer branding, warmer leads, and a much bigger content footprint.

Scripe makes it easy to run these programs at scale.

With a team setup, you can:

- Manage multiple personal brands inside one workspace.
- Assign clear roles and access levels.
- Keep all content, calendars, and analytics organized.

## How to Set Up Scripe for Corporate Influencer Programs

A corporate influencer program works best **when someone takes ownership of it** — whether that’s a team manager, a marketing team member, or a hired content strategist. Having a dedicated person ensures consistency, accountability, and measurable results.

This guide is written for that person. It will walk you through how to set up Scripe for teams step by step, so you can manage personal brands, coordinate content, and track analytics across your organization.

When setting up Scripe for teams, you can choose between two approaches depending on **how much involvement** you want team members to have in the content creation process:

- **DWY (Done-With-You)** → Team members are actively involved in writing their own content. You provide structure, strategy, and support inside Scripe, while they draft posts and shape their personal voice. [_If that's the case, then read this setup guide →_](/agencies/client-setup)
- **DFY (Done-For-You)** → A strategist or marketing lead creates the content inside Scripe. Team members only log in to review and approve the content — keeping their effort minimal while ensuring consistent output. [_If that's the case, then read this setup guide →_](/agencies/setup-for-client)
