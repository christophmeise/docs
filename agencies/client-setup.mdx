If your **client** is paying for Scripe (instead of you) and wants to collaborate with you, there’s no need to share login details. Scripe’s **multiple workspace system** makes it easy and secure to work together.

If your client has their own Scripe subscription:

1. They create or open their **workspace**.

<Info>
  To collaborate with other people in Scripe, your client needs a **workspace**. Personal accounts (created during onboarding without selecting “workspace”) can’t invite other people. 
</Info>

2. They go to **Settings → People**.
3. They invite you using your email address.
4. Once invited, you’ll see their workspace listed under **Switch Workspace** in your account.
5. Click their workspace name to access it and collaborate.

### **Setup Checklist for your Client:**

✅ Sign up to Scripe from your Chrome Browser.\
✅ Create a Team Workspace.\
✅ Set up your Personal Brand.\
✅ Install the [Chrome Extension](/account/chrome).\
✅ [Create Subscription](https://scripe.mintlify.app/administration/billing) (Team plan, Yearly or Monthly setup)\
