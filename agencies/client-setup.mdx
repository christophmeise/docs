A **DWY (Done-With-You) offer** is a service model where you and the client **work together** to build or execute something, instead of you doing it all for them (DFY: Done-For-You) or just teaching them (DIY: Do-It-Yourself).

In this scenario, the **client is paying for Scripe (instead of you)** and you both collaborate on their workspace.

Here's how to collaborate in Scripe on a DWY offer:

## DWY Scripe Set-Up

Before working with a client, we recommend that you:

1. **Get familiar with Scripe** ‚Äì follow this [step-by-step guide](/started/easy-set-up) to set up your own workspace and learn the platform inside out.
2. [Join our Partner Office Hours](https://lu.ma/scripe?k=c) ‚Äì bring questions, learn best practices, and get support on how to run DWY offers successfully with Scripe.

<Tip>
  **Prefer a faster track?** You can also [book a paid setup sprint](https://calendly.com/eva-erm/scripe-implementation), where we‚Äôll get everything ready for you.
</Tip>

### 1. What to send to your Client for Set-Up

Copy and paste the following checklist and send it to your client (make sure to add your partner link and emails where prompted).

**Scripe Set-Up Checklist:**

‚úÖ¬†Sign up to Scripe from your Chrome or Edge Browser using the following link: `partner link`.

‚úÖ¬†Name your workspace and go through the product onboarding.

‚úÖ¬†Create a **Pro Plan** account (if more than 3 personal brands, create an **Agency Plan** account).

‚úÖ¬†Install the [Scripe Extension](/account/chrome) during the onboarding and [connect the LinkedIn account](/administration/li-connection) on your dashboard.

‚úÖ¬†Go to **Settings ‚Üí People**.

‚úÖ¬†Invite the following emails as a second Admin to the Workspace: `add the email(s).`

üëâ¬†Optional: Invite further members to the workspace.

üëâ¬†Optional: Read this [Setup Guide](/started/easy-set-up) for assistance.

### **Important reminders:**

- Ensure your clients set up a **Pro or Agency account**  so you can collaborate within Scripe.
- Remind your client to use a **Chrome or Edge Browser** to set up their Scripe Account and to install the [**Scripe Extension**](/administration/chrome) during the Onboarding Process.
- To get rewarded and earn commission, make sure your clients sign up via **your referral link**.
- If you‚Äôre not yet in the program, sign up for the [Referral Partner Program here](https://scripe.firstpromoter.com/).

### 2. How to access your Client's Workspace

1. Once invited, you‚Äôll see their workspace listed under **Switch Workspace** in your account.
2. Click their workspace name to access it and collaborate.

<Tip>
  This is also how you switch between different clients' workspaces in case you work with multiple clients within Scripe.
</Tip>

### 3. Meet in your Scripe Introduction Call

Complete the Scripe Setup with your client and introduce them to all relevant workflows.

**Checklist for your Scripe Intro Calls with Clients:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure the client has the Scripe Extension installed & the LinkedIn account is connected.">
    For your clients, both badges on the Scripe dashboard need to show as **green**:

    - **Analytics badge** confirms that the [Chrome/Edge extension](/administration/chrome) is installed.
    - **Scheduling badge** confirms the client‚Äôs [LinkedIn account is connected](/administration/li-connection).

    You should advise clients that the LinkedIn connection may occasionally expire. Scripe will highlight this directly on their dashboard, prompting them to refresh the connection when needed.

    ![Li Connection Jp](/images/li-connection.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Content Strategy together and give guidance if needed.">
    Explain to the client that the [content strategy settings](https://scripe.mintlify.app/content-strategy/content-strategy) define what types of posts they want to publish, how often, and who they're trying to reach.

    It allows Scripe to recommend the best post formats for their goals and measure content performance in a way that actually makes sense to reach these goals.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload min. 2 files to the Knowledge Base.">
    When talking to your client, explain that the [Knowledge Base](/sidebar/knowledge) works best when it includes **relevant input materials**, such as:

    - Sales decks or one-pagers
    - Case studies or success stories
    - Website copy, landing pages, or blog posts
    - ICP or persona descriptions
    - Recorded calls, webinars, or podcasts

    Once these are uploaded, Scripe will begin generating [weekly AI-powered Content Suggestions](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered) (done-for-you post ideas). You‚Äôll revisit these suggestions together later in the call to review and refine them.

    <Tip>
      Want to give even more value to your client? Use our ICP Questionnaire template to define their ICP, fill it out together, and then upload it to the Knowledge Base.

      **Get your template in:**

      - [German](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_INzccuwM-ebcP2KZmEBJ1NMomHSYqCIpaqKzhyPReQ/edit?usp=sharing)
      - [English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh4FvXvWrliZ6UmRiF05fwadGEp7-Jkg-_e_82S7H6Q/edit?usp=sharing)

      **Best practices to fill it out:**

      - Avoid generic answers (‚Äúwe target tech companies‚Äù). Get really specific.
      - Use the client‚Äôs own language ‚Äî how do they describe their challenges?
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the first scriped post together.">
    Show how you create a post [from voice](https://scripe.mintlify.app/one-post/audio) ‚Äì¬†then let the client do it themselves.

    Once the post is ready, guide the client through the [**Scripe Editor**](/editor/editor): make sure they know they can tweak the post in the editor and [use the chat](/editor/chat) to adjust the post to their liking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let the client schedule their first post &¬†guide them through the Content Calendar">
    From the editor, explain the different scheduling options:

    - **Plan in Scripe calendar** ‚Üí add the post to the calendar as a draft (not set to publish).
    - **Schedule for LinkedIn** ‚Üí set the post for automatic publishing.
    - **Publish immediately** ‚Üí push it live on LinkedIn right away.

    Guide your client to schedule their first Scripe-generated post on LinkedIn.

    Next, go to the **Calendar view** and clarify the status indicators:

    üü° **Yellow Dot = Planned**. This means the post is just a draft and won‚Äôt be published on LinkedIn. If you hover over the post in the calendar, you‚Äôll see it marked as ‚ÄúPost Draft.‚Äù

    üîµ **Blue Dot = Scheduled**. This shows the post is scheduled and will be published automatically. Hovering over the post in the calendar will show you the exact date.

    We recommend using this moment to **plan ahead**:

    - Add notes or content ideas into upcoming calendar slots, guided by the Content Strategy suggestions.
    - Click on any suggestion to explore the recommended post format and see example posts for inspiration.

    ![Calendar 2 Jp](/images/calendar-2.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Guide the client to connect Scripe with their WhatsApp">
    Guide your client to install the [WhatsApp integration](/integrations/whats-app) to instantly send ideas or content snippets straight into Scripe whenever inspiration strikes.

    To install the WhatsApp integration, you can guide your client like this:

    1. In your dashboard sidebar, go to [Sources](/sidebar/uploads).
    2. At the top of the page, click **Connect WhatsApp**.
    3. A QR code will be displayed.
    4. Open WhatsApp on your phone, scan the QR code, and you‚Äôre connected.
    5. Send an audio or a text message to see it in action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit and guide the client through Analytics.">
    Show your client how to read their Analytics dashboard and highlight two key points:

    1. **Focus on what works** ‚Üí Encourage them to double down on content formats, topics, and styles that are already performing well.
    2. **Keep Analytics up to date** ‚Üí Remind them that Analytics only refreshes when the Scripe extension is installed **and** LinkedIn is open in the same browser. If either is missing, their data won‚Äôt update.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go through the AI-powered Content Suggestions">
    Wait for the [AI-powered Content Suggestions](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered) to finish generating, then help your client choose and plan their first posts.

    - **Open & edit suggestions**: Click any suggestion on the dashboard to preview the full post. Show your client that they can edit the text, adjust formatting, or generate alternative versions with different hooks directly in the post editor, as you showed them earlier.
    - **Where to find all suggestions**: Remind them that all suggestions are also available under **Posts ‚Üí Suggested** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Action Steps until next call or deadline.">
    We recommend that, as a next step, you ask the client to create and plan 2-3 posts and assign them to you for review.
  </Step>
</Steps>
