A **DWY (Done-With-You) offer** is a service model where you and the client **work together** to build or execute something, instead of you doing it all for them (DFY: Done-For-You) or just teaching them (DIY: Do-It-Yourself).

In this scenario, the **client is paying for Scripe (instead of you)** and you both collaborate on their workspace.

Here's how to collaborate in Scripe on a DWY offer:

## DWY Scripe Set-Up

Before working with a client, we recommend that you:

1. **Get familiar with Scripe** â€“ follow this [step-by-step guide](/started/easy-set-up) to set up your own workspace and learn the platform inside out.
2. [Join our Partner Office Hours](https://lu.ma/scripe?k=c) â€“ bring questions, learn best practices, and get support on how to run DWY offers successfully with Scripe.

### 1. What to send to your Client for Set-Up

Copy and paste the following checklist and send it to your client (make sure to add your partner link and emails where prompted).

**Scripe Set-Up Checklist:**

âœ…Â Sign up to Scripe from your Chrome or Edge Browser using the following link: `partner link`.

âœ…Â Name your workspace and go through the product onboarding.

âœ…Â Create a **Pro Plan** account (if more than 3 personal brands, create an **Agency Plan** account).

âœ…Â Install the [Scripe Extension](/account/chrome) during the onboarding and [connect the LinkedIn account](/administration/li-connection) on your dashboard.

âœ…Â Go to **Settings â†’ People**.

âœ…Â Invite the following emails as a second Admin to the Workspace: `add the email(s).`

ðŸ‘‰Â Optional: Invite further members to the workspace.

ðŸ‘‰Â Optional: Read this [Setup Guide](/started/easy-set-up) for assistance.

### **Important reminders:**

- Ensure your clients set up a **Pro or Agency account**  so you can collaborate within Scripe.
- Remind your client to use a **Chrome or Edge Browser** to set up their Scripe Account and to install the [**Scripe Extension**](/administration/chrome) during the Onboarding Process.
- To get rewarded and earn commission, make sure your clients sign up via **your referral link**.
- If youâ€™re not yet in the program, sign up for the [Referral Partner Program here](https://scripe.firstpromoter.com/).

### 2. How to access your Client's Workspace

1. Once invited, youâ€™ll see their workspace listed under **Switch Workspace** in your account.
2. Click their workspace name to access it and collaborate.

<Tip>
  This is also how you switch between different clients' workspaces in case you work with multiple clients within Scripe.

### 3. Meet in your Scripe Introduction Call

Complete the Scripe Setup with your client and introduce them to all relevant workflows.

âœ…Â Create the first scriped post together.\
**ðŸ‘‰**Â Recommended: Show how you create a post [from voice](https://scripe.mintlify.app/one-post/audio) â€“Â then let the client do it themselves.

âœ…Â Visit and guide the client through [**Analytics**](https://scripe.mintlify.app/sidebar/analytics).

âœ…Â Wait for [**AI-powered Content Suggestions**](https://scripe.mintlify.app/multiple-posts/ai-powered) to be completed and help the client choose and plan the first posts.

âœ…Â Set Action Steps until next call or deadline.\
