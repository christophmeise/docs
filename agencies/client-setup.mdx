If your **client is paying for Scripe (instead of you)** and wants to collaborate with you, thereâ€™s no need to share login details. Scripe makes it easy and secure to work together.

Here's how to set it up:

## What to send to your Client for Set-Up:

<Info>
  TL;DR: Send this link to your client: [Scripe Easy Set-Up Guide](/started/easy-set-up).
</Info>

âœ…Â Sign up to Scripe from your Chrome or Edge Browser using the following link: `partner link`.\
âœ…Â Name your workspace and go through the product onboarding.\
âœ…Â Create a **Pro Plan** account (if more than 3 personal brands, create an **Agency Plan** account).\
âœ…Â Set up your Personal Brand(s) by clicking "Add Personal Brand".\
âœ…Â Install the [Scripe Extension](/account/chrome) and connect \
\
\
âœ…Â [Invite You as a second Admin to the Workspace.](https://scripe.mintlify.app/team-plan/invite)\
âœ…Â Optional: [Invite further team members via the Settings panel](https://scripe.mintlify.app/team-plan/people).

<Note>
  Remind your client to use a Chrome Browser to set up their Scripe Account and to install the [Chrome Extension](https://scripe.mintlify.app/account/chrome) during the Onboarding Process.
</Note>

This is how your client can add you to their workspace:

1. They create or open their own **workspace** (Pro or Agency Plan required).
2. They go to **Settings â†’ People**.
3. They invite you using your email address.
4. Once invited, youâ€™ll see their workspace listed under **Switch Workspace** in your account.
5. Click their workspace name to access it and collaborate.

### **Setup Checklist for your Client:**

âœ…Â Sign up to Scripe from your Chrome Browser.\
âœ…Â Create a Pro account (if more than 3 personal brands, create an Agency account).\
âœ…Â Set up your Personal Brand(s).\
âœ…Â Install the [Chrome Extension](/account/chrome).\
âœ…Â [Invite You as a second Admin to the Workspace.](https://scripe.mintlify.app/team-plan/invite)\
