## TL;DR: Why Agencies Use Scripe

- Manage unlimited clients & brands with **one login**.
- Run entire **employee advocacy programs** in one workspace.

## Managing Clients at Scale in Scripe

### 1. Workspaces: Organize by Client

In an **Agency plan**, you get **unlimited workspaces**.

Workspaces act as collaboration hubs where you and your team (or your client‚Äôs team) can manage everything in one place.

- **One client = one workspace** ‚Üí Keeps their content, analytics, and strategy completely separate.
- **Unlimited personal brands & users per workspace** ‚Üí Add as many LinkedIn accounts and collaborators as you need. No per-seat fees.
- **One bill across all workspaces** ‚Üí Even if you manage dozens of clients, everything is handled under a single subscription.

<Tip>
  If multiple people from one company work together, keep them in the **same workspace**. \
  \
  If you manage completely different companies (which shouldn‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs data), create **separate workspaces**.

**If you're ready to set up Scripe for your clients, please follow the tutorials below:**

üëâ If you're setting up Scripe for a client and you're paying for the subscription, [read this tutorial](/agencies/setup-for-client).

üëâ If your client is paying for Scripe, then they need to invite you to collaborate on their workspace. In this case, [read this tutorial](/agencies/client-setup).

### 2. Personal Brands: LinkedIn Accounts You Manage

A **personal brand** in Scripe is simply one LinkedIn account connected to your workspace.

- Billing scales with the number of personal brands (LinkedIn accounts), not the number of users.
- Each client might have several executives or team members ‚Äî that means multiple personal brands in one workspace.
- As an agency, you can add personal brands across multiple workspaces, all tied into your single Agency subscription.

<Tip>
  Example: If you manage 12 LinkedIn profiles across 4 clients, you‚Äôll create **4 workspaces** with a total of **12 personal brands**. All of them roll up into your Agency plan billing.
</Tip>
