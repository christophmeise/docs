The **Client Dashboard** in Scripe is a **limited workspace** designed for clients who need visibility into content progress and results — without editing or publishing access.

It’s ideal for agencies, consultants, and internal teams who want to keep stakeholders informed while maintaining full control over execution.

## What clients can access:

Clients have access to a **limited set of features**, focused on transparency and review:

### **Posts**

Clients can view posts in **three states only**:

- In Review
- Scheduled
- Published

Within Posts, clients can:

- Read all assigned post drafts
- See which users are assigned as reviewers
- Request reviews from other workspace members

Clients **cannot**:

- Create posts
- Edit content
- Publish or schedule posts

### **Calendar**

The Calendar works the same as for other users, with one key difference:

**Clients can:**

- View posting days and planned content **only for posts with the following statuses:**
  - In Review
  - Scheduled
  - Published
- See and comment on **campaigns** on the calendar

**Clients cannot:**

- Edit campaigns
- Change schedules
- Move or reschedule posts

This keeps planning transparent without breaking execution flow.

### **Analytics**

Clients see the **same Analytics view as any personal brand**. Analytics are **view-only** and give clients a clear understanding of content impact.

### **Inbox**

The Inbox is used for **review management only**.

Clients can:

- See posts assigned to them for review
- Receive review notifications inside Scripe

### **WhatsApp**

Clients can connect **their own WhatsApp account** to Scripe (bottom-left corner).

This allows them to:

- Send voice notes
- Share raw ideas or updates
- Submit audio content for the team to turn into posts

This is especially useful for [async collaboration](/collaborations/async) and idea capture.
