Learn how to use your homepage and dashboard in Scripe to track performance, follow personalized content suggestions, and let it learn from you, to sound like you.

Here’s what you’ll find when you land on the Home screen of your [Personal Brand](/account/personalbrand):

## Performance Snapshot

At the top, you'll see a real-time view of your follower count, post count, and average impressions. This gives you a quick pulse on how your content is performing.

## Content Strategy Tracker

Next to your stats, you’ll see a visual of your [**Content Strategy**](/content-strategy/content-strategy), broken down by [content pillar](/content-strategy/content-pillars) (Personal, Educational, Organizational, and Promotional).

Scripe keeps track of your target frequency and adapts in real time based on your publishing habits. The chart updates automatically as you publish posts.

## Knowledge Base Status

The [**Knowledge Base**](/sidebar/knowledge) is where Scripe learns from your uploaded content to write smarter posts tailored to your voice and expertise. You can upload files, paste text, or add links to articles, pages, and documents you want Scripe to learn from.

Your Knowledge Base status is shown on the top right of your dashboard. Once you’ve added enough sources, you’ll see your **learning status** increase, helping Scripe better understand what matters to you (and your audience).

## Weekly Personalized Suggestions

Every week, Scripe generates new post ideas tailored to your LinkedIn audience and your recent activity. These show up under “Weekly personalized post ideas”, and they’re linked directly to your [content strategy](/content-strategy/content-strategy).

Clicking any of these suggestions will open your post drafts that are within the topic, ready to be published, so you can schedule or tweak them right away.

## Weekly Calendar

At the bottom of your Home dashboard, you’ll find a weekly calendar view of your posts.

Here's how it works:

- **Colored tags** match the post formats in your [content strategy](/content-strategy/content-strategy).
  - Click on a suggestion to instantly open relevant post drafts within that post format, ready for you to schedule or fine-tune.
  - These suggestions update dynamically based on what you've published, helping you fill in gaps while staying on brand
  - No drafts yet? No problem. You’ll also find a **"Learn how to create this format"** link to explore best practices and real examples before you write.

- Click the **Settings** button on the top right of your calendar to fine-tune your posting schedule. Here, you can:
  - **Set your time zone** — used for scheduling and queuing posts
  - Choose **which days of the week** you want to post on
  - **Define your scheduling timetable** — pick specific posting times (they become purple on your calendar).
