The **Personal Brand Dashboard** is your home inside Scripe.

It’s where Scripe learns from your content, analyzes your performance, and gives you personalized ideas so you always know what to post next.

## What You’ll Find on the Dashboard

### **1. Your Chat**

You’ll see a search bar where you can:

- Ask Scripe to generate post ideas
- Repurpose your existing posts
- Analyze your performance
- Brainstorm content aligned with your Personal Brand

This is the quickest way to get content done in seconds.

### 2. Weekly Personalized Suggestions

Every week, Scripe generates new post ideas tailored to your LinkedIn audience and your recent activity. These show up under “Weekly personalized post ideas”, and they’re linked directly to your [content strategy](/content-strategy/content-strategy).

Clicking any of these suggestions will open your post drafts that are within the topic, ready to be published, so you can schedule or tweak them right away.

### 3. Repurpose Trending Posts

Here, Scripe scans top creators in niches similar to yours and shows you:

- High-performing posts
- Clear angles and hooks
- What made the post work
- A one-click repurpose option

You can also **search for creators** to find inspiration from specific voices you like.
