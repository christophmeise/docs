The **Inbox** keeps all your **Scripe notifications** organized in one place, from campaign updates to comments and product updates.

It helps you stay up to date with everything happening across your workspace without missing an important action.

## User-Specific & Personal-Brand-Specific

Your **Inbox** shows notifications based on **two contexts**:

- **User-specific** → These are notifications sent directly to you (for example, when a teammate mentions you in a comment).
- **Personal-brand-specific** → You’ll also see notifications related to the personal brand(s) you’re currently in — such as campaign updates, brand-wide comments, and product notifications.

This means your inbox adapts to both your individual activity and your Personal Brand’s content workflow, keeping everything centralized.

## Filtering Notifications

At the top of the inbox, you can filter what you see:

- **Unread & Read** → Shows all notifications
- **Unread** → Only new ones you haven’t opened
- **Archived** → Notifications you’ve marked as done
