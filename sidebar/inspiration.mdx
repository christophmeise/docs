The **Inspiration** page in Scripe is your personal feed of high-performing LinkedIn content. 

Here’s what you can do with it:

**Follow creators**: When you follow a creator, Scripe will analyze their writing and use it to refine your [Tone of Voice](/sidebar/tov). It’s an easy way to mirror the style of top-performing authors you admire.

**Repurpose content**: Click the sparkly icon on any post to instantly turn it into a post draft you can customize. It’s perfect for fast repurposing of content you love.

**Filter the feed by industry or language**: Use the dropdown menus on the top right to refine the feed by sector or language.

**Sort the feed by what matters most**: Choose between Most Relevant, Most Recent, or Most Engagement to find content that fits your research goals.
