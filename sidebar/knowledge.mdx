The Knowledge Base is where Scripe gets smarter — about you, your business, and your unique way of communicating.

By uploading interviews, links, audio notes, or text, you teach Scripe what matters. This information is used to personalize your content, improve post quality, and generate posts with more precision.

## How to add Knowledge

Click **“Add Knowledge”** and choose one of the three options:

- **From text**: paste in anything you want Scripe to remember (e.g., your brand story, pitch, FAQ).
- **From file**: upload audio files, PDFs, docs, etc. Scripe will scan and learn from it.
- **From website link**: paste in a URL and Scripe will automatically fetch and learn from the page content.

Each entry will appear in your Knowledge Base list, showing upload date and content type.

<Tip>
  The more context you give Scripe, the sharper it gets.

### Edit or delete entries

Click the **three dots** (`...`) next to any entry to:

- **Rename** the entry for easier tracking
- **Delete** it if it's no longer relevant
