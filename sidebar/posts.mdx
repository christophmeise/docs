Manage your entire content pipeline, from ideas to published posts, in one place.

The **Posts page** in your sidebar is where all your content lives: from AI-generated ideas to published LinkedIn posts. It’s designed to help you organize, review, and publish posts faster, without the chaos of external tools or scattered feedback.

## Choose Your View

You can now toggle between **List view** and **Board (Kanban) view** — giving you full flexibility over how you organize your content.

- **List view**: See all your posts in a sortable table format.
- **Board view**: Perfect for visual thinkers. Drag and drop posts across columns that represent each status in your workflow (e.g., Draft → In Review → Scheduled).

Your chosen view is remembered automatically, so you can work in your preferred format every time.

### Filter and Display Options

You can filter posts in both views by:

- Status
- Labels
- Campaigns
- Content Type

And you can customize what information is visible in your current view by toggling display properties, for example:

- Status
- Scheduled Date
- Labels
- Campaign
- Content Type
- Assigned Reviewer

## Post Statuses

Each post in Scripe moves through a series of **statuses** (like _Draft_, _In Progress_, _In Review_, _Scheduled_, or _Published_).

<Warning>
  These statuses are defined at the workspace level, meaning they’re consistent across all personal brands in your workspace. You can customize these statuses under [Workspace Settings → Post Status](/settings/post-status). When you update or delete a status in Workspace Settings, the change automatically applies across all personal brands.
</Warning>

These are the default posts statuses from Scripe:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Suggested" icon="sparkles">
    This is where you'll find all your AI-generated post ideas. These are personalized based on your tone, audience, and strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Draft" icon="note-medical">
    This is the default status for all posts generated with Scripe. You can set up as many draft statuses as you want.
  </Card>
  <Card title="In Progress" icon="pencil">
    You can move posts from Draft to In Progress to clearly separate ideas that are still in the drafting stage from posts that are actively being worked on.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review" icon="user-clock">
    Posts that were assigned to review by another user are automatically assigned to this status. You can set up as many review statuses as you want.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduled" icon="clock">
    Posts that are ready to go and have been scheduled appear here. They’ll be automatically published according to the settings you've chosen.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Published" icon="check">
    All posts that have gone live, whether created inside Scripe or not, show up here. This includes ones imported from LinkedIn if your account is connected.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
