The **Posts page** in your sidebar is where all your content lives: from AI-generated ideas to published LinkedIn posts. It’s designed to help you organize, review, and publish posts faster, without the chaos of external tools or scattered feedback.

## Posts are organized into the following tabs:

  <Card title="Draft" icon="pen">
    This is the default tab you'll always fall into when clicking Posts in the sidebar. Here you can see all your posts that are currently being written or edited.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suggested" icon="sparkles">
    This is where Scripe stores all your [**AI-generated post ideas**](/multiple-posts/ai-powered). These are personalized based on your tone, audience, and strategy. Posts are grouped by the week they were generated.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review" icon="rev">
    If you're in a [**team workspace**](/team-plan/workspace), this is your approval workflow hub. Here you can view, approve, or reject posts assigned to you for feedback and track the ones you’ve submitted for review.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduled" icon="clock">
    Posts that are ready to go and have been scheduled appear here. They’ll be automatically published according to the settings you've chosen.
