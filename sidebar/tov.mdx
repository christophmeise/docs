Scripe adapts to your unique writing style, so your posts sound like **_you_**, not a robot.

The Tone of Voice page is where you personalize that style, blending your own voice with the style of creators you admire.

## Adaptive Tone of Voice

When this is turned on, Scripe:

- Connects to your LinkedIn profile
- Analyzes your top-performing posts
- Builds a dynamic voice profile that evolves as you post more

<Tip>
  The more you post, the smarter this gets. Scripe constantly updates your voice based on what works best.
</Tip>

## Followed Creators

Use the [**Inspiration page**](/sidebar/inspiration) to discover and follow creators whose style you admire. Once you follow someone there, they’ll show up here in your **Followed Creators** section.

From here, you can:

- See all the creators you’re currently following
- **Manage or delete** any followed creators
- Let Scripe subtly adapt your tone of voice to match their writing style

## Writing Settings

Customize how Scripe formats your posts:

- **Post Language:** Set the default language for your content.
- **Post Formatting:** Choose between:
  - Standard
  - Formatted
  - Chunky
  - Short
  - Emojis
- **Post Length:** Use the slider to set your preferred post length, from super short to super long.

Hit **Save Changes** to lock in your writing preferences.
