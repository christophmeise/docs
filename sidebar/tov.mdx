The Tone of Voice page is where you personalize the writing style inside Scripe.

Scripe analyzes your best-performing LinkedIn posts and learns how you naturally communicate — your rhythm, phrasing, sentence structure, and emotional tone. It then adapts your future posts to sound just like you.

You can further customize and fine-tune everything: from your writing length and language to emojis, formatting, and even favorite CTAs.

Here’s how to set it up and make the most of it:

1. Click on the Personal Brand you want to edit.
2. On your left sidebar, click Tone of Voice.

### Step 1: Turn On the Adaptive Tone of Voice

When this is turned on, Scripe:

- Connects to your LinkedIn profile
- Analyzes your top-performing posts
- Builds a dynamic voice profile that evolves as you post more

<Tip>
  The more you post, the smarter this gets. Scripe constantly updates your voice based on what works best.

### Step 2: Configure Your Post Structure

Under Post Structure, you can define how your posts are written.

- **Post Language:** Choose between English 🇺🇸 or German 🇩🇪.
- **Sentence Length:** Decide whether you prefer **short**, **standard**, or **long** sentences.
- **Post Length:** Control the overall text length — short, standard, or long.
- **Emoji Frequency:** Select how often emojis should be used in your posts.

These settings help Scripe match your communication style.

### Step 3: Add a Custom Footer (Optional)

Turn on the Custom Footer toggle to automatically add a signature or recurring note at the bottom of every post (up to 500 characters).

This is perfect for adding:

- A recurring call to action (“Let’s connect 👋”)
- A recurring tagline
- A personal note

### Step 4: Follow Creators to Adapt Their Style

Use the [**Inspiration page**](/sidebar/inspiration) to discover and follow creators whose style you admire. Once you follow someone there, they’ll show up here in your **Followed Creators** section.

From here, you can:

- See all the creators you’re currently following
- **Manage or delete** any followed creators
- Let Scripe subtly adapt your tone of voice to match their writing style

### Step 5: Fine-Tune with Advanced Settings

In the Advanced section, you can give Scripe very specific guidance on how to write for you.

  **Warning:** Changes to advanced settings may reduce post quality if not used carefully.

Here you can define:

**1. Custom Instructions with Do's and Don'ts**

Provide detailed instructions about your writing style, tone, and preferences. Include personality traits, patterns to use or avoid, and any specific guidelines.

Examples:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do's" icon="check">
    🔸 Write with high enthusiasm, vulnerability, and playful confidence.

    🔸 Frequently start posts with a personal anecdote or confession, then pivot to lessons or advice.

    🔸 Use arrows and bullet points to structure lists, often with a conversational lead-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don'ts" icon="do-not-enter">
    - 🔸 Avoid generic descriptions.
    - 🔸 Avoid words like: “Moreover,” “Furthermore,” “In conclusion," etc.
    - 🔸 Don't write in a salesy or overly promotional tone.
    - 🔸 Don't overuse jargon or buzzwords without context.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**2. Frequently Used Emojis**

Specify which emojis you use most. These will be prioritized in your posts.

**3. Frequently Used List Symbols**

Add custom symbols for bullet points and formatting (e.g., →, •, ▸, ✓).

**4. Common CTAs**

List call-to-action patterns you typically use to engage your audience.

**Examples:**

- Drop it in the comments or shoot me a DM!
- Let me know below.
- Would love to hear how you see it!
- For more info, drop me a comment or DM :)

Hit **Save Changes** to lock in your writing preferences.

### Step 7: Reset if You Need a Fresh Start

If you ever want to start over, use **Reset Tone of Voice**.

This will overwrite your manual settings (custom instructions, emojis, CTAs) and revert back to Scripe’s original AI-analyzed tone.
