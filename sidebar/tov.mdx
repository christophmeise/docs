The Tone of Voice page is where you personalize the writing style inside Scripe.

Scripe analyzes your best-performing LinkedIn posts and learns how you naturally communicate — your rhythm, phrasing, sentence structure, and emotional tone. It then adapts your future posts to sound just like you.

You can further customize and fine-tune everything: from your writing length and language to emojis, formatting, and even favorite CTAs.

Here’s how to set it up and make the most of it.

## Set Up Tone of Voice for the Company:

Keep every post across your team consistent with your company’s communication style.

The Workspace Tone of Voice lets you define writing rules that automatically apply to all personal brands in your workspace — ensuring every message sounds aligned and on-brand.

Before you start. Here’s how to find the Tone of Voice settings for your workspace:

1. Go to your Workspace Overview.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Tone of Voice** under the **Workspace** section.

### Step 1: Set Your Workspace Guidelines

In the Workspace Guidelines field, add your company’s tone of voice rules: including both the _Do’s_ and _Don’ts_ for how your team should write.

Keep it clear and actionable so everyone understands what good communication looks like.

**Examples:**

- Spell Scripe with P
- Avoid generic descriptions
- Be specific and tangible

<Info>
  **Important:** Everything you add to this field will also appear on each Personal Brand’s Tone of Voice page.
</Info>

<Note>
  You can use up to **2000 characters** for detailed brand writing rules, but we recommend keeping it simple and fine-tuning the tone later within each Personal Brand.
</Note>

### Step 2: Allow Personal Brands to Add Their Own Touch

Below your workspace guidelines, you’ll find the option:

> **Allow personal brands to add custom instructions**

If this is **enabled**, individuals in your workspace can add their own style preferences — but Scripe will always respect your company guidelines first.

If it’s **disabled**, all posts will strictly follow the workspace tone.

<Tip>
  **Recommended:** Keep this turned **on** to maintain brand consistency while allowing each individual to sound authentically themselves.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add a Workspace-Wide Footer (Optional)

You can also activate a workspace-wide footer that automatically appears at the end of every post created within your workspace.

**Examples:**

- “Powered by Scripe 💜”
- “Opinions are my own, but powered by our team spirit.”
- “We’re hiring! Check careers at...”

This helps unify all team posts with a small branded signature.

## Set Up Tone of Voice for each Personal Brand

Before you start. Here’s how to find the Tone of Voice settings for your Personal Brand:

1. Click on the Personal Brand you want to edit.
2. On your left sidebar, click Tone of Voice.

### Step 1: Turn On the Adaptive Tone of Voice

When this is turned on, Scripe:

- Connects to your LinkedIn profile
- Analyzes your top-performing posts
- Builds a dynamic voice profile that evolves as you post more

<Tip>
  The more you post, the smarter this gets. Scripe constantly updates your voice based on what works best.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Configure Your Post Structure

Under Post Structure, you can define how your posts are written.

- **Post Language:** Choose between English 🇺🇸 or German 🇩🇪.
- **Sentence Length:** Decide whether you prefer **short**, **standard**, or **long** sentences.
- **Post Length:** Control the overall text length — short, standard, or long.
- **Emoji Frequency:** Select how often emojis should be used in your posts.

These settings help Scripe match your communication style.

### Step 3: Add a Custom Footer (Optional)

Turn on the Custom Footer toggle to automatically add a signature or recurring note at the bottom of every post (up to 500 characters).

This is perfect for adding:

- A recurring call to action (“Let’s connect 👋”)
- A recurring tagline
- A personal note

### Step 4: Follow Creators to Adapt Their Style

Use the [**Inspiration page**](/sidebar/inspiration) to discover and follow creators whose style you admire. Once you follow someone there, they’ll show up here in your **Followed Creators** section.

From here, you can:

- See all the creators you’re currently following
- **Manage or delete** any followed creators
- Let Scripe subtly adapt your tone of voice to match their writing style

### Step 5: Fine-Tune with Advanced Settings

In the Advanced section, you can give Scripe very specific guidance on how to write for you.

<Danger>
  **Warning:** Changes to advanced settings may reduce post quality if not used carefully.
</Danger>

Here you can define:

**1. Custom Instructions with Do's and Don'ts**

Provide detailed instructions about your writing style, tone, and preferences. Include personality traits, patterns to use or avoid, and any specific guidelines.

Examples:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do's" icon="check">
    🔸 Write with high enthusiasm, vulnerability, and playful confidence.

    🔸 Frequently start posts with a personal anecdote or confession, then pivot to lessons or advice.

    🔸 Use arrows and bullet points to structure lists, often with a conversational lead-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don'ts" icon="do-not-enter">
    - 🔸 Avoid generic descriptions.
    - 🔸 Avoid words like: “Moreover,” “Furthermore,” “In conclusion," etc.
    - 🔸 Don't write in a salesy or overly promotional tone.
    - 🔸 Don't overuse jargon or buzzwords without context.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**2. Frequently Used Emojis**

Specify which emojis you use most. These will be prioritized in your posts.

**3. Frequently Used List Symbols**

Add custom symbols for bullet points and formatting (e.g., →, •, ▸, ✓).

**4. Common CTAs**

List call-to-action patterns you typically use to engage your audience.

**Examples:**

- Drop it in the comments or shoot me a DM!
- Let me know below.
- Would love to hear how you see it!
- For more info, drop me a comment or DM :)

Hit **Save Changes** to lock in your writing preferences.

### Step 7: Reset if You Need a Fresh Start

If you ever want to start over, use **Reset Tone of Voice**.

This will overwrite your manual settings (custom instructions, emojis, CTAs) and revert back to Scripe’s original AI-analyzed tone.
