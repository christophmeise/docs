## How Scripe AI works

When you open the **Scripe AI (Beta)** section in your sidebar, you’ll land on a simple search bar where you can **ask Scripe anything.**

Here, you can type or say anything you want help with — from brainstorming ideas to writing new posts. Scripe AI will generate suggestions based on your input, recent content, and current LinkedIn trends.

Here are a few quick-start suggestions:

- _Brainstorm relevant post ideas_
- _Research trending topics_
- _Show viral posts about AI_
- _Create a new post about what’s new in tech this week_
- _Analyze my recent posts_

### Brainstorming new ideas

When you choose **Brainstorm relevant post ideas**, Scripe AI generates tailored post ideas based on your profile, content patterns, and audience topics.

Each idea includes:

1. A title & a short description explaining the idea suggestion.
2. Two action buttons:
   - **Give Input:** Add your own context or experience to build on the idea suggested.
   - **Generate Hooks:** Instantly turn the idea into scroll-stopping hooks.

This helps you move from concept → structured post in just a few clicks.

### Smart Research & Inspiration

Scripe AI doesn’t just pull ideas from thin air: it combines your **Knowledge Base**, **LinkedIn insights**, and **external sources** to suggest the most relevant content directions.

You’ll see a blend of:

- **Your Knowledge (Scripe sources)**
- **Web Research (high-authority content)**
- **Viral Inspiration (real LinkedIn posts performing well)**

This helps you choose topics backed by data and real-world engagement.

### Analyze My Recent Posts

Scripe AI can also analyze your recent LinkedIn performance to surface insights, engagement trends, and improvement ideas. When you choose “Analyze my recent posts”, it scans your last 10 LinkedIn posts and generates a full breakdown.

### Research Trending Topics

Choosing “Research trending topics” helps you discover what’s currently hot on LinkedIn and beyond. Scripe AI asks what kind of trends you want to explore. Once you pick your focus area, it pulls data from high-authority sources and summarizes what’s gaining traction right now.

## Add Sources to Your Chat

You can also use the **➕ button** to bring in **existing content** already uploaded to Scripe.

For example:

- Meeting Recordings or PDFs in your [Sources](/editor/sources)
- Strategy docs or campaign briefs from your [Knowledge Base](/sidebar/pb-kb)

![Scripe Ai Sources Jp](/images/scripe-ai-sources.jpg)

**Once added, you can ask Scripe AI to:**

- Generate content from those documents (e.g., turn a PDF into a LinkedIn post)
- Brainstorm content ideas inspired by the material
- Extract key takeaways or summarize points that align with your content strategy
- Compare or map the document’s topics against your brand voice or campaign goals

<Tip>
  Example: Upload a strategy document to your Sources or Knowledge Base → go to Scripe AI → click ➕ to attach it → ask “Which parts align with my content strategy?”
