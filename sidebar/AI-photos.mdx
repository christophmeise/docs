The AI Photos feature (Pro only) allows you to upload your own photos, enabling Scripe to generate high-quality, personalized branding images that resemble you.

## How to Set it Up

1. **Upload 10–20 images** of yourself (max 10 MB each; `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`).
2. Make sure the photos:
   - Show your face clearly
   - Avoid group pics, sunglasses, or blurry angles
   - Represent different angles, lighting, and expressions

<Tip>
  The better the quality of the photos you upload, the better the AI portraits.
</Tip>

3. Once 10\+ valid photos are uploaded, click **“Pictures are good, train AI”**
4. Training completes in a few minutes, and you're ready to generate AI images.

### Important Notes

- **You can only train the AI once**, so pick your best pictures\!
- If you need to retrain for any reason, please contact support at `hello@scripe.io`

<Warning>
  AI image generation isn’t always perfect. Sometimes the results may look a bit off — that’s totally normal\! That’s also why Scripe gives you a **generous monthly 30 images limit**, so you can generate more until you find the perfect fit.
</Warning>

## How to Generate AI Photos in Scripe

Once your AI training is complete, you can generate custom AI images directly from the **post editor**. Here's how:

1. In your post draft, click **“Add media to your post”** → select the **AI Photos** tab.
2. You'll see a box to enter your **image prompt**.
   - By default, Scripe offers you a ready-to-use prompt with the best settings for the image output.
   - You can also **write your own prompt** or click **“Generate a prompt based on the post”** to auto-generate one.

   <Info>
     **Important:** Always include your **first name** in the prompt so the AI knows it should generate images of _you_.
   </Info>
3. Click **“Run AI image generation”** to generate the photo.
4. The image will appear on the right once the generation is complete, and you can insert it directly into your post by clicking "Set picture as post image".

<Danger>
  **Scripe does not store your AI photos**. If you want to reuse them later, be sure to **download** your favorites **right after generating.**
</Danger>
