The **Calendar** in Scripe is your personal command center to plan and manage your content publishing schedule across the month or week, all in one clean view.

## What you can do on the Calendar page:

#### 1. See all your scheduled posts at a glance

Each post (from notes to scheduled to publish) you've scheduled to a specific date appears as a clickable card on your calendar. From these cards you can:

- **Open and preview it**
- **Track its status**
- **Jump straight into editing**
- **Reschedule or unschedule it**

#### 2. Add and manage Notes

Click the **"Notes"** button (top-right) to access all your saved content ideas. These notes are:

- Fully editable
- Connected to post creation (turn a note into a post in one click)
- Great for organizing ideas that aren’t scheduled yet

#### 3. Switch between views

Use the **Month/Week toggle** to adjust your view depending on how detailed you want to go. Month view gives you the big picture; week view helps you focus on the immediate next steps.

#### 4. Customize your Scheduling Settings

Click **“Settings”** to:

- Set your **timezone**
- Choose whether your week starts on **Monday or Sunday**
- Define your **posting schedule** (e.g., every Tue/Thu/Fri at 9am). Your preferred posting time will show up as a purple slot in the weekly calendar.

#### 5. Get Post Format suggestions based on your Strategy

Scripe helps you stay on track with your content goals by displaying **suggested** [**post formats**](/content-strategy/content-formats) as **color-coded cards**. These are auto-generated based on your [**strategy settings**](/content-strategy/content-strategy).

Click on a suggestion to instantly open relevant post drafts within that post format, ready for you to schedule or fine-tune.

No drafts yet? No problem. You’ll also find a **"Learn how to create this format"** link to explore best practices and real examples before you write.
