The **Calendar** in Scripe is your personal command center to plan and manage your content publishing schedule across the month or week, all in one clean view.

## What you can do on the Calendar page:

#### 1. See all your scheduled posts at a glance

Each post (from notes to scheduled to publish) you've scheduled to a specific date appears as a clickable card on your calendar.

From these cards, you can:

- **Open and preview the post**
- **Track its status**
  - üü° **Yellow Dot = Planned**. This means the post is just a draft and won‚Äôt be published on LinkedIn. If you hover over the post in the calendar, you‚Äôll see it marked as ‚ÄúPost Draft.‚Äù
  - üîµ **Blue Dot = Scheduled**. This shows the post is scheduled and will be published automatically. Hovering over the post in the calendar will show you the exact date.

<Tip>
  You can also see all your posts (across every stage) by clicking on [**Posts**](/sidebar/posts)** **in your sidebar and navigating through the stages on the top bar.
</Tip>

- **Jump straight into editing**
- **Reschedule or unschedule it**

<Danger>
  Using the "Remove post from calendar" only hides it from view ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt change its stage. **If the post is scheduled, it will still be published. **To make sure a scheduled post won‚Äôt go live, you‚Äôll need to actively unschedule it.
</Danger>

#### 2. Add and manage Notes

Click the **"Notes"** button (top-right) to access all your saved content ideas. These notes are:

- Fully editable
- Connected to post creation (turn a note into a post in one click)
- Great for organizing ideas that aren‚Äôt scheduled yet

#### 3. Switch between views

Use the **Month/Week toggle** to adjust your view depending on how detailed you want to go. Month view gives you the big picture; week view helps you focus on the immediate next steps.

#### 4. Customize your Scheduling Settings

Click **‚ÄúSettings‚Äù** to:

- Set your **timezone**
- Choose whether your week starts on **Monday or Sunday**
- Define your **posting schedule** (e.g., every Tue/Thu/Fri at 9am). Your preferred posting time will show up as a purple slot in the weekly calendar.

#### 5. Get Post Format suggestions based on your Strategy

Scripe helps you stay on track with your content goals by displaying **suggested** [**post formats**](/content-strategy/content-formats) as **color-coded cards**. These are auto-generated based on your [**strategy settings**](/content-strategy/content-strategy).

Click on a suggestion to instantly open relevant post drafts within that post format, ready for you to schedule or fine-tune.
