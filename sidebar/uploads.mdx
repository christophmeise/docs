The **Sources** tab is where you upload any long-form content you want Scripe to learn from and transform into LinkedIn-ready posts. This includes interviews, podcasts, webinars, documents, and more.

## How to Add a Source

Click the **\+ Add Source** button and choose from three options:

- [**File to content**](/multiple-posts/file) (upload PDFs, audio, video, or docs)
- [**YouTube to content**](/multiple-posts/youtube) (paste a YouTube link)
- [**Content interview**](/multiple-posts/interview) (run an AI-guided conversation)

<Tip>
  Tip: Toggle “Add to [Knowledge Base](/sidebar/knowledge)” on if you want the source to train your post suggestions.

## Manage the Source

Clicking on a processed source opens a detailed view where you’ll find two powerful tabs:

### **1. Generated Posts**

- **Post Ideas:** Scripe generates multiple post drafts based on the file you uploaded (e.g., audio, video, PDF, etc.).
- **Post Score:** Each post idea is ranked using a **content score**, which evaluates how well the post aligns with key performance factors such as Goal alignment, Engagement potential and Value and insights.
- **Strategy Tags:** Scripe highlights the strategic intent behind each post, such as: generating leads, attracting partners, educating your audience, building credibility, etc.
- **Hooks:** Each post suggestion comes with scroll-stopping hooks. You can:
  - Click on the arrows to preview all the different hook variations
  - Favorite the ones you like most
  - Use any hook to instantly create a full post
