The **Approvals Inbox** helps you manage and review post approval requests sent **directly to you** by your teammates.

This feature ensures that all LinkedIn posts requiring feedback or approval are centralized in one place — so you can review, approve, or decline them in seconds.

Here, you’ll see a list of posts pending your review, including:

- The **author’s name and avatar**
- The **planned post date and time**
- The **title of the post** for quick context
- **Accept** and **Decline** buttons to take action immediately

## User-Level, Not Brand-Level

It’s important to note that the Approvals Inbox is **user-specific**, not tied to a personal brand or workspace. 

That means:

- You’ll **only see approval requests that were sent specifically to you**, not to your team or brand.
- If multiple reviewers exist in your workspace, each will see **only their assigned requests**.

This ensures approvals stay clear, private, and easy to manage per reviewer.

## Approving or Declining a Post

When a teammate submits a post for review:

1. It appears automatically in your **Approvals Inbox**.
2. You can preview the content and see the deadline for approval.
3. You can leave comments on the post for the author.
4. Click **Accept** to approve the post for publishing, or **Decline** to send it back for edits.

If declined, the post will return to the author with your feedback, allowing them to update and resubmit it.
