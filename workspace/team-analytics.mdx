### Performance Analysis

The Performance Analysis section breaks down your team’s content performance in detail — and can be filtered by Posts, Impressions, Likes, or Comments depending on what you want to measure.

You can toggle between these filters at the top-right of the section to see how each metric affects your team’s performance view.

It includes:

- **Content Type Performance:** Average results per [content category](/strategy/content-formats) (e.g. Personal, Promotional, Educational, Organizational). This helps you see which type of content your team’s audience engages with most.
- **Top Post Formats:** The best-performing [post formats](/strategy/content-formats). Switching filters here lets you analyze what drives the most likes versus impressions, for example.
- **Media Type Performance:** How different media formats perform (text-only vs image posts).
- **Content Performance by Labels:** Compare performance for your [pre-set content labels](/settings/labels).
- **Content Performance by Campaigns:** See the overall results of your [Campaigns](/workspace/campaigns) for the selected period of time.

<Info>
  Campaigns are shown if they have posts created during the selected date range. Performance metrics reflect all engagement data for those posts and not only for the selected date range.
