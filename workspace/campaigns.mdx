The Campaigns feature in Scripe helps you plan, organize, and activate company-wide content initiatives — such as launches, events, or marketing pushes — in one shared workspace.

It allows teams to align their content around specific moments and track participation across every brand or personal account in your workspace.

**Campaigns are perfect for:**

- Launches or announcements (e.g., _Scripe 2.0 Launch_)
- Events and webinars (e.g., _Live Webinar_, _IRL Event_)
- Product updates or partnerships
- Community or seasonal challenges

## Creating a Campaign in Scripe

To view and manage campaigns, go to **Workspace → Campaigns**. From this page, you’ll see an overview of all company campaigns.

**To create a new campaign in Scripe:**

1. Click **New Campaign**.
2. Add your campaign **name** and **summary**.
3. Select an **emoji** for your campaign.
4. Set a **date range** to define the campaign period.
5. Upload any **supporting files** (e.g., visuals or templates).
6. Add a **description** or briefing for your team.
7. Add **labels** (optional) to organize your campaigns by theme (e.g., _Community Challenge_, _Product Launch_).
8. Click **Create**.

Your campaign will now appear in both the **Campaigns list** and the **Calendar view** for all Personal Brands in your workspace.

## Linking Posts to a Campaign

When creating, editing, or managing your posts, you can link them to a campaign directly.

This allows your team to track all related content and performance in one place. Linked posts appear inside the campaign view under **Linked Posts**.

This helps identify which team members are contributing to the campaign and what content is already live.

## Collaborating on Campaigns

Each campaign has its own comment section where teammates can share ideas, feedback, or confirm that their post has been submitted.

You can also tag teammates or use comments to coordinate post schedules or final checks.

## Measuring Campaign Impact

Once posts are linked, Scripe tracks their performance across key metrics.

You can see aggregated results under [Analytics](/workspace/team-analytics) → Campaign Performance, where each campaign displays its performance growth and average impressions.
