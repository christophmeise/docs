## How to Use It

1. On your **Scripe dashboard**, click the **“Create posts”** button (top-left sidebar)
2. In the pop-up menu, select **“Generate from text”**
3. Paste or type your thoughts into the text box
4. Click **“Generate post from text”**
5. **Choose a Hook**, regenerate new hook options, or use a custom hook for your post

<Tip>
  **You don’t need to give instructions** on how the post should be written. Scripe automatically understands the content, pulls what’s relevant, and turns it into a well-written LinkedIn post — no prompt engineering needed.

Scripe will turn your input into a post draft — ready for you to [edit](/editor/editor), [schedule](/editor/schedule), or publish!

<Tip>
  For best results, aim for at least 100 characters. The more context you give, the better your post will be!
