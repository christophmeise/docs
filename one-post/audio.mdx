## How to Use It

1. On your **Scripe dashboard**, click the **“Create posts”** button (top-left sidebar)
2. In the pop-up menu, select **“Generate from voice”**
3. Choose your **recording language**
4. (Optional) Add quick notes to guide your recording
   - In the note box, you can write a few bullets to help guide your recording. These notes won’t be shown anywhere, they’re just for you.
     - ✏️ Why are you talking about this topic?
     - ✏️ What do you want your audience to take away?
5. Click **“Start voice recording”** and speak your thoughts
6. You can **pause** and **resume** if needed
7. When finished, click **“Finish recording”**

Scripe will transcribe and turn your voice memo into a post draft, ready for you to edit, schedule, or publish\!

<Tip>
  Talk as if you’re explaining something to a friend. Natural, conversational recordings work best\!
