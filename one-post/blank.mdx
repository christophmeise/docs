This feature lets you start with a clean slate. If you already have a post idea or draft in mind, use this option to open the editor and build your post from scratch.

### How to Use It

- On your Scripe dashboard, click the **“Create posts”** button (top-left sidebar)
- In the pop-up menu, select **“Blank”**
- Click **“Create blank post”** to open the editor

You can now write, format, and schedule your post in the [post editor](/editor/editor).

<Tip>
  This option is ideal for fine-tuning finished drafts or pasting in content you’ve already written elsewhere.
