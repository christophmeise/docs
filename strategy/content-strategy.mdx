Scripe helps you build a repeatable system for LinkedIn by generating [weekly post ideas](/multiple-posts/ai-powered) tailored to your goals and audience. This starts with your content strategy.

Your content strategy settings define what types of posts you want to publish, how often, and who you're trying to reach. It allows Scripe to:

- Recommend the best [post formats](/content-strategy/content-formats) for your goals
- Suggest [post ideas every week](/multiple-posts/ai-powered) based on trends
- Automatically categorize your drafts to keep your calendar organized
- Measure content performance in a way that actually makes sense to reach your pre-set goals

### How to set up your Content Strategy in Scripe

From your dashboard, click **Create content strategy**. You’ll go through a short setup where you’ll be asked to define:

1. **Your role** – so Scripe can tailor suggestions to what’s relevant
2. **Your goals** – e.g., Employer Branding, Media & PR, Career Opportunities
3. **Your audience** – such as clients, investors, talents, or colleagues
4. **Your key topics** – up to 4 topics you want to be known for
5. **Your posting schedule** – how often you want to post per week

Once done, Scripe generates:

- **A personalized positioning statement** – to guide your voice and messaging
- **A set of** [**post formats**](/content-strategy/content-formats) – tailored to help you hit your goals every month

You can fine-tune both before clicking **Save & Finish Strategy**.

<Tip>
  Need to adjust later? You can always revisit and edit your strategy from the **Content Strategy** dashboard.

## Your Content Strategy Dashboard

Once your content strategy is set up, your **Content Strategy Dashboard** helps you track your monthly progress and stay aligned with your goals.

Here’s what each section shows:

### Strategy Overview

- **Purpose Statement**: Your personalized positioning statement that guides your content tone and focus.
- **Goals**: The objectives you chose (e.g., Company Awareness, Employer Branding).
- **Audience**: The audience segments you’re targeting (e.g., Clients, Partners, Investors).
- **Topics**: The key subjects you want to be known for.

You can edit any of these settings by clicking the ✎ icon next to each section.

<Accordion title="Why Your Purpose Statement Matters" icon="heart-circle-exclamation">
  Before you post anything on LinkedIn, it’s essential to know _why_ you’re posting in the first place. That’s what your **purpose statement** is for.

  It gives direction to your content — helping you avoid random, disconnected posts that don’t serve your goals. A clear purpose keeps your messaging consistent, builds trust with your audience, and ensures that every post you create contributes to something bigger (whether that’s positioning your expertise, attracting clients, building a personal brand, or supporting your company’s mission).

  Without a purpose statement, it’s easy to fall into the trap of just “posting to post.” **With one, you’re building something with intention.**
</Accordion>

### Monthly Progress

Shows how many posts you’ve published out of your total monthly target, broken down by [content pillar](/content-strategy/content-formats). Each ring segment fills up as you hit your goals across these content categories.

### Post Format Targets

Tracks how many posts you’ve done for each [post format](/content-strategy/content-formats) in your strategy. Scripe recommends these formats based on your goals and updates your progress in real time.

<Info>
  You can always edit your post formats by clicking the ⚙️ engine icon in the top left corner of the page. Adjust your strategy anytime to match your evolving goals.
