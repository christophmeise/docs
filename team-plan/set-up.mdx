Scripe for Teams makes it easy to manage content across multiple [personal brands](/account/personalbrand). Whether you're setting up LinkedIn content systems for team members or clients (if you're an agency), this guide walks you through how to get your [workspace](/team-plan/workspace) ready and start creating personal brands for each profile.

## 1. Start with the Right Workspace

To manage multiple personal brands, you need to be in a **team workspace**. Personal workspaces only allow for one personal brand.

- Already have a personal Scripe account? Click **Switch Workspace** from your dashboard.
- To create a new team workspace, click **Add Workspace**, give it a name (e.g., “Client Workspace” or “Team Content”), and click **Create Workspace**.

<Info>
  You can [invite other members](/team-plan/invite) right away or skip and do it later. 
</Info>

At this step, you can also:

- **Transfer your personal brand** to this team workspace, if you already have one.
- **Cancel your personal subscription** (if any) and consolidate everything into the team plan.

## 2. Set Up Personal Brands

Once you're in your team workspace:

- Click **Create new personal brand**
- Follow the onboarding steps (you can set the tone of voice and posting frequency per team member or client; you’ll always be able to adjust these later)

### Important: LinkedIn Login Setup

Before setting up a new personal brand, ensure that **you're not logged into any LinkedIn account** in your current Chrome profile.

Why? Because Scripe’s setup will sync with the active LinkedIn login, so you don’t want to accidentally sync the wrong one.

<Icon icon="diamond-exclamation" /> **To avoid this:**

- Use a Chrome profile where you're not logged into any LinkedIn account, **or**
- Create a new Chrome profile entirely (you can name it something like “Scripe Setup”)

Repeat this step for each team member or client you're setting up.

## 3. Chrome Extension Requirement

Every [personal brand](/account/personalbrand) in Scripe must have the [Scripe Chrome Extension](/account/chrome) installed and connected to their [LinkedIn account](/account/li-connection).

You have two options:

- **Install it yourself** if you manage their account
- **Let the team member or client install it later** from their end

As long as it's connected to the correct LinkedIn profile, Scripe can pull data and assist with scheduling and publishing.

## 4. Final Touches

You’ll wrap up the setup by adding the team member or client to the workspace and [assigning them proper roles and personal brands](/team-plan/people). From here, you can manage [strategy](/content-strategy/content-strategy), post creation, scheduling, and performance, all in one place.
