Scripe makes it easy to collaborate with others by inviting them directly or letting them request access via your email domain. Here’s how to manage both options.

## How to invite someone to your workspace

1. **Go to your team workspace dashboard**
2. Click on **Organization settings**
3. Open the **People** tab
4. In the Members section, click on the **Invitations** tab
5. Click **Invite** in the top-right corner
6. Enter the user’s email and [assign a role](/team-plan/people) (Admin, Editor, Viewer, or Personal Brand)
7. Send the invite

The user will receive an email invitation to join your organization. Once they accept, they’ll appear in the Members tab.

<Info>
  In the Team plan, [billing](/administration/billing) is based on the number of [**Personal Brands**](/account/personalbrand) you manage, not how many people are in your [workspace](/account/workspaces). So you can invite as many team members as needed.
</Info>

## Manage verified domains

To allow anyone with a specific email domain to request access automatically:

1. Go to the **Invitations** tab
2. Click **\+ Manage verified domains**
3. Add your company email domain (e.g. `@yourcompany.com`)

Now, anyone signing up with that domain will be able to request access without needing an invite.

## How to approve access requests

If someone signs up using your verified domain (e.g. `@yourcompany.com`), their request to join will appear in the **Requests** tab.

To approve them:

1. Open the **Requests** tab (next to Members and Invitations)
2. You’ll see a list of users who requested access
3. Click **Approve** or **Reject** next to each request

Once approved, they’ll be added to the Members list. You can assign them to a [Personal Brand](/account/personalbrand) or [adjust their role](/team-plan/people) anytime.
