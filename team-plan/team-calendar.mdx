The **Company Calendar** gives your team a clear overview of all scheduled content, helping you align across personal brands, themes, and posting cadence.

### What you can do:

- **See all drafted, scheduled, and published posts** at a glance by personal brand.
- **Switch views** between month and week to better match your planning workflow.
- **Add notes** to any date and assign them to any personal brand: ideal for campaign ideas, content reminders, or creative inputs.
- **Schedule posts** directly from the calendar by selecting a draft and assigning a time slot.
  - When scheduling posts, you can filter the drafts by format (e.g., Personal Milestones, Launches) to stay on top of your strategy mix.

<Tip>
  For personal planning, head to each individual [personal brand’s calendar](/sidebar/calendar) to manage posts separately.
