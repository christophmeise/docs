If you're on a Teams plan, you can add multiple members to your organization and assign them different roles and access levels.

## How to manage Members & Roles in Scripe

1. Make sure you're on your **team workspace dashboard**.
2. Click on **Organization settings**.
3. Navigate to the **People** tab.

Here you can:

- See the list of all members in your organization
- Check when each member joined
- [Manage invitations](/team-plan/invite) and requests to join your workspace
- Change their roles:
  - **Admin** – Full, unrestricted access to all areas and features of Scripe. Can manage team settings, view analytics, oversee all profiles, and publish content on behalf of any profile.
  - **Team Manager** – Comprehensive access to all profiles, analytics, and dashboard functions. **Cannot publish content**, maintaining a focus on management and strategy oversight.
  - **Content Assistant** – Limited to managing and **supporting a single personal brand profile**. Does not have access to other team profiles or organizational data, ensuring privacy and focus.
  - **Personal Brand** – **Restricted to their own profile** and data only. Ideal for individuals managing their personal brand without access to other team profiles or insights.
- Remove members if they no longer need access (via the three-dot menu)

### Assign users to Personal Brands

To control who works on which profile:

1. Go to the **Assign users to projects** section (just below the members list).
2. For each user, choose which Personal Brand(s) they should have access to.
3. You can assign multiple users to the same brand, or assign one user to several brands.

### Important: You pay per Personal Brand, not per member

In Scripe, [billing](/administration/billing) is based on the number of [**Personal Brands**](/account/personalbrand) you manage, not how many people are in your [workspace](/account/workspaces). That means:

- You can invite as many team members, freelancers, or clients as needed
- Each [Personal Brand](/account/personalbrand) slot gives you full feature access
- You choose who gets access to which brand(s), and with what level of permission

This setup makes it easy to collaborate across departments, agencies, or teams without extra cost for each user.
