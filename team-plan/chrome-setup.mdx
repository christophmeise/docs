The **Scripe Chrome Extension** is an essential tool that connects your LinkedIn profile with Scripe. It allows Scripe to retrieve analytics data, access your past posts, and keep your account activity updated, ensuring you get the full value from the platform.

If you manage **multiple Personal Brands** within Scripe (i.e., on a Team Plan), special care is needed:

- Each LinkedIn profile must be linked to a **separate Chrome browser profile**.
- This prevents conflicts between sessions and ensures the Chrome extension correctly syncs with the intended LinkedIn account.

<Info>
  **Why?** Because the Chrome extension automatically reads the LinkedIn profile you're logged into. If multiple LinkedIn profiles are managed in the same Chrome profile, it can cause errors or sync issues.

To set up a new personal brand on behalf of someone else, you therefore need a new Chrome Profile that can be linked to a new Chrome Extension and a different LinkedIn Profile. Here's how:

## 1. Create a New Chrome Profile

You don’t need a new Gmail account to create a separate Chrome profile. 

Just click your profile icon in the top right of Chrome, select **“Add Chrome Profile”**, then choose **“Continue without an account”** to set up a new profile.

  Tip: Name your Chrome Profile with a reference to the Personal Brand you're setting up.
</Tip>

## 2. Connect the accounts

1. In this Chrome profile, log in to the desired LinkedIn Account.
2. Go to Scripe and log in to your [team workspace](/team-plan/workspace).
3. Download the [Chrome Extension](/account/chrome) and connect it to the Personal Brand.
