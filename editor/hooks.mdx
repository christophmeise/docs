**First impressions matter.** Hooks are bold, scroll-stopping opening lines designed to grab attention and boost engagement on LinkedIn.

### How It Works

When you're editing a post in Scripe, the **Hooks** panel on the left shows you a curated list of high-converting opening lines.

- Browse different styles: bold, emotional, curiosity-driven, data-backed, or storytelling
- Click any hook to **instantly copy it**, then paste it at the top of your post to grab attention fast

<Tip>
  The hook sets the tone. Try testing different options to see what resonates most with your audience.
