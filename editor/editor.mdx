The **Post Editor** is where you edit and perfect your LinkedIn posts inside Scripe.

## Editing Text

- Simply click into the text area to start writing or editing your post.
- Standard text editing features are available, including:
  - **Bold**, **Italic**, and **Underline** formatting
  - **Bullet points** or **numbered lists**
  - Quick access to editing options with the toolbar that appears when you select text.

## Rewrite with the help of AI

The **Rewrite Tool** helps you quickly improve, rephrase, or polish your LinkedIn posts without leaving the editor.

- **Highlight** the text you want to improve or rewrite.
- The Rewrite menu will appear automatically, offering quick options to:
  - **Make shorter**: Condense the selected text while keeping the meaning.
  - **Make longer**: Expand on the idea with more details or context.
  - **Say differently**: Reword the sentence in a new way while keeping the same meaning.
  - **Fix spelling & grammar**: Correct any typos, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing.
- After selecting an option, Scripe will automatically generate a suggestion.

Once a rewrite suggestion appears:

- You can **Accept** the new version to replace your original text.
- **Discard** the suggestion if you want to keep your original version.
- **Try again** if you'd like a different rewrite suggestion.

This gives you full control over whether or not you apply the AI-generated changes.

## Using Mentions

In the Scripe Post Editor, you can tag companies directly in your LinkedIn posts by using mentions.

- Type **@** followed by the company’s name.
- A dropdown will appear showing matching companies.
- Select the correct company from the list to insert the mention

<Info>
  **Tagging personal LinkedIn profiles is not supported** due to LinkedIn’s official API limitations. Even when tagging companies, the results are **limited**.
</Info>

## Adding Emojis

You can easily add emojis to your post inside the Scripe Editor to make your content more engaging and visually appealing.

- Click on the **emoji face icon** located in the editor toolbar.
- Browse or search for the emoji you want.
- Click on the emoji to insert it directly into your post.

## Previewing Your Post

Before publishing, you can preview exactly how your post will look on LinkedIn.

- Click on the **eye icon** located in the editor toolbar.
- Choose between **Desktop view** and **Mobile view** to see how your post will appear on different devices.

<Tip>
  Always check both views to make sure your post formatting looks great everywhere.

## Copy a Post to Clipboard

If you want to publish your post manually without scheduling through Scripe, you can quickly copy it without manually selecting the text.

- Click on the **three dots (···)** at the editor toolbar.
- Select **Copy to Clipboard**.
- Your entire post will be instantly copied, ready to paste wherever you need (like directly into LinkedIn).

## Adding and Managing Comments

The **Comment** feature in the Scripe Post Editor allows you to leave feedback, notes, or suggestions directly on specific parts of your post — ideal for solo editing or team collaboration.

### How to Add a Comment

1. **Highlight** the text you want to comment on.
2. Click **Comment** from the quick action menu.
3. Type your feedback or note in the comment box that appears.

### How to View and Manage Comments

- To view all comments on a post, click the **speech bubble icon** with a number at the top right of the editor.
- This will open a panel where you can see every active comment and reply to them if needed.

<Warning>
  If you click Resolve on a comment, it will be permanently deleted. Only click Resolve when the comment has been fully addressed, as it cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Best Uses for Comments

- Leave reminders for edits or improvements.
- Ask questions or suggest changes when collaborating.
- Keep track of feedback during drafting and revision.

<Info>
  **Note:** Comments are internal only and will not appear in your final published post.

## Requesting a Review (Team Plan Only)

If you're on Scripe’s **Team Plan**, you can request a teammate to review your draft before publishing.

- Click on the **opposite arrows** on the editor toolbar.
- Select **Request Review**.
- Choose an **Assigned User** from the dropdown list.
- Set a **Review Due Date** by picking a deadline from the calendar.
- Click **Request Review** to send the review request.

The assigned reviewer will be notified and reminded to complete the review by the selected due date.

## Managing Post Notifications (Team Plan Only)

If you're on Scripe’s **Team Plan**, you can also control notifications for individual posts using the **notification bell icon** in the editor toolbar.

- Click the **notification bell icon** on the editor toolbar.
- You’ll have the option to **unsubscribe** from updates related to that specific post.

This is helpful if you no longer want to receive notifications about changes, comments, or review updates for a particular draft.

## Delete a Post

You can delete a draft post directly from the editor if you no longer need it.

- Click on the **three dots (···)** on the editor toolbar.
- Select **Delete**.
- Confirm the action to permanently remove the post from your workspace.

<Warning>
  Deleting a post is permanent and cannot be undone.
