Use the **Add Media** button in the editor to upload visuals that boost engagement and bring your content to life. 

## Media Suggestions

Media Suggestions show you which post format (like a carousel) is likely to perform best based on data from similar posts. Scripe explains _why_ the format is recommended and lets you add it with one click, so you can choose the most effective way to publish without guessing.
