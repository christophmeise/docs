## How It Works

1. In the post editor, click **“Add media to your post”**
2. A pop-up will appear where you can choose what to upload:
   - **Image**: Upload photos from your device
   - **Video**: Share a short video clip
   - **PDF**: Upload a carousel or any document
3. You can also explore:
   - **AI Photos** to generate on-brand images of you in seconds ([learn how to use AI Photos →](/sidebar/AI-photos))
   - **Unsplash** for free, high-quality stock images
   - **Giphy** to add a fun GIF to your post
   - **Carousel** to transform written content into a polished, swipeable LinkedIn carousel, ready to catch attention and boost engagement ([learn how to use the Carousel feature here →](/editor/carousel))

Once uploaded, your media will be attached to the post preview and ready to publish.

<Tip>
  To upload a Scripe carousel, download it as a PDF and upload it here—or directly on LinkedIn via the “Document” option for best formatting.
