The **Transcript** panel shows the full original input that was used to generate your post, whether it came from a voice recording, document, video, or conversation.

### How It Works

Whenever you create a post using:

- **Voice memo**
- **Text input**
- **Uploaded file (audio, video, document)**
- **YouTube video**
- **Content interview**

Scripe automatically transcribes the content and displays the full original input in the **Transcript** tab (left side of your editor).

<Tip>
  Use the transcript to pull additional quotes or insights you may have missed when generating the post\!
