### How It Works

- From your editor, click the **"Carousel"** tab on the left sidebar
- Click **"Generate Carousel from Post"** to instantly create a visual version of your content
- Customize your design:
  - Update your **name**, **handle**, and **avatar** under the **Brand** tab
  - Adjust **fonts**, **theme colors**, and **slide text**
  - Control layout and design elements like opacity and alignment

Use the arrows to navigate between slides and tweak each one individually to fit your tone and message.

<Tip>
  Use carousels for storytelling, list posts, or step-by-step breakdowns — they work especially well for educational or inspirational content\!
