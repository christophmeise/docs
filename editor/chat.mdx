The **Chat** feature inside Scripe acts as your personal writing assistant. It helps you quickly edit, rework, and polish your LinkedIn posts without leaving the editor.

## What You Can Do in Chat

You can use Chat to:

- **Create post variation**: Instantly generate an alternative version of your current post to compare or try new angles.
  - After a variation is suggested, you can choose to **apply** it to your draft.
  - If you want to revisit previous versions, you can always use the **Undo/Redo arrows** at the top of the Chat panel to move between edits easily.

<Info>
  You stay in **full control**. Nothing is replaced unless you decide to apply the variation.

- **Change post length**: Shorten or expand your post based on your needs.
- **Change formatting and structure**: Reorganize the layout, fix flow, or improve the overall readability of your post.
- **Change hook**: Pick one from a curated list of high-converting opening lines.

### Ask Chat for Help

Beyond rewriting your post, you can also **chat freely** with the Chat tool, just like you would with ChatGPT.

You can ask questions or give instructions to improve your post, such as:

- "Can you make this post more engaging?"
- "Suggest a stronger hook for this topic."
- "What are three ways to end this post with a call to action?"

The Chat will respond with ideas, rewrites, or improvements based on your request, helping you fine-tune your post even further.

<Tip>
  You don't have to stick to pre-set options. You can type any instruction that would help you craft a better LinkedIn post!
