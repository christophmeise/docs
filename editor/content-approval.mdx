Scripe makes it easy to manage content creation across multiple people through a built-in approval workflow. Whether you're working with a social media team, reviewing posts for clients, or managing multiple personal brands, here's how the approval process works inside a personal brand workspace.

## Step 1: Request Review

Once you finish drafting a post in the [post editor](/editor/editor), click **Request Review** (double arrows) on the top right. A window will open where you can:

- Assign the review to a specific teammate
- Set a review due date (optional)

This ensures everyone stays aligned and knows when their input is expected.

## Step 2: Reviewer takes action

The assigned reviewer will receive a notification via email.

To review a post, all a reviewer has to do is open Scripe, open any Personal Brand and go to the [Approvals](/sidebar/approvals) Inbox.

Here they can:

- Open the posts assigned to them to **Approve or Reject** them, optionally leaving feedback
- **Comment directly on the draft** for suggested edits or discussion. [Here's how →](/editor/editor)

This ensures feedback is captured in context and the process remains transparent for both sides.

## Step 3: You get notified

After a post is reviewed, you get a notification both on your email and on your Scripe Inbox. To access your Inbox, all you have to do is open Scripe, open any Personal Brand, and go to the [Inbox](/sidebar/inbox).
