In Scripe, a **workspace** is your content environment. Each workspace contains one or more **personal brands** (the profiles you create and post content for).

There are two types of workspaces:

## Can I Have Both?

Yes\! Many Scripe users have access to:

- Their **own personal workspace** (e.g. for their personal LinkedIn).
- One or more **organization workspaces** (e.g. for a company or client).

You can switch between them at any time â€” no need to log in and out.

## How to Switch Workspaces ðŸ”„

1. Click your **profile icon** in the top-left corner of Scripe.
2. Select **"Switch workspace."**
3. A menu will appear showing all the workspaces you belong to.
4. Click on the workspace you want to enter (e.g. "Scripe" for your organization, or "Personal").

### Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Switching a Workspace and a Personal Brand?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Switching workspace" icon="arrows-cross" color="#9353d3">
    - Moving between environments (e.g. from your companyâ€™s workspace to your own).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Switching personal brand" icon="arrows-down-to-people" color="#9353d3">
    - Changing the brand you're working on _within_ the current workspace.

<Tip>
  You can be part of multiple organizational workspaces and even manage your own personal one alongside them. Just use the workspace switcher to move between them anytime.
