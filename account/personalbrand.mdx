The **Personal Brand** page on Scripe allows you to manage your personal brand’s account details, update your LinkedIn profile link, transfer ownership, or delete your personal brand entirely.

<Info>
  In Scripe, a **Personal Brand** refers to the LinkedIn profile you manage through the platform. You can manage multiple Personal Brands on the Team plan, and a single Personal Brand in the Starter and Professional Plans.

- You can find your LinkedIn Profile URL by visiting your LinkedIn:
  - Visit your LinkedIn profile.
  - Copy and paste the full profile link into the field.
- After adding or updating your LinkedIn URL, click **Save Changes** to confirm.

## Transfer to Organization

<Warning>
  This section is only available for users on a Personal Plan. If you are not part of a Team workspace, you will not see this option.
</Warning>

With this feature, you can move your current **personal brand** into a **Team Workspace**.

**To transfer:**

1. Click **Transfer to Organization**.
2. Select **Cancel Subscription for Personal Account** to stop being charged for the Personal Plan.
3. Choose the Organization you’ve already been invited to.
4. Confirm by clicking **I’m sure, transfer personal brand**.

Your personal brand will then move from your personal workspace into the selected Team Workspace. The Organization will be billed for this additional personal brand.

## Transfer to Personal

<Warning>
  This section is only available for users on a Team Plan. If you are not part of a Team workspace, you will not see this option.
</Warning>

With this feature, you can move your current **personal brand** from a Team Workspace back into a **personal workspace**.

**To transfer:**

- Click the **Transfer to Personal** button.
- This will move your project out of the organization structure into your individual account.

When you transfer your Personal Brand to your Personal Workspace, you can keep managing your LinkedIn profile independently, without being connected to a team. Billing will return to your personal account instead of the organization’s.

This option is ideal if you’re leaving a team or planning to downgrade to the Professional or Starter plan.

## Delete Personal Brand

- You can permanently delete your personal brand and all associated data.
- To proceed, click the **Delete personal brand** button.
