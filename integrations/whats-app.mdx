With our WhatsApp integration, you can easily upload voice or text memos directly into Scripe, making it even faster to capture ideas and turn them into content.

This guide walks you through setup and usage.

## Step 1: Connect Your WhatsApp

### Via Settings:

1. Go to your **Settings** in Scripe and click on the [Personal Brand](/account/personalbrand) you want to connect.
2. Under **WhatsApp Connections**, click **Add Connection**.
3. A QR code will appear.
4. Scan the QR code with your phone to connect.

### Via Uploads:

1. In your dashboard sidebar, go to [Uploads](/sidebar/uploads).
2. At the top of the page, click **Connect WhatsApp**.
3. A QR code will be displayed.
4. Open WhatsApp on your phone, scan the QR code, and you’re connected.

Once connected, you’ll receive a confirmation message in WhatsApp with:

- The project name you’re connected to
- Instructions on how to submit your inputs
- A **Visit FAQ** link (to this help article)
- An **Unsubscribe** button (to disconnect)

## Step 2: Send Voice or Text Memos

After connecting your device:

- Open the chat in WhatsApp.
- Record a **voice memo** or type a **text message**.
- Send it as you normally would.

**What happens next:**

- Scripe processes your memo.
- You’ll receive a confirmation link in WhatsApp.
- Your memo appears in Scripe under your [project uploads](/sidebar/uploads).
- Click on the memo to see the posts generated from it.

## Manage Your WhatsApp Connection

You can manage connections anytime from your **Settings → Personal Brand → Whatsapp Connections**.

Options available:

- **Add** a connection
- **Remove** existing connection

<Warning>
  **A WhatsApp number can only be active on one personal brand at a time.** If you connect your device to a new project, it will automatically disconnect from the previous one.
</Warning>

**Example workflow for switching your WhatsApp connection to another Personal Brand:**

1. You connect your WhatsApp to Personal Brand A.
2. You send a voice memo. It shows up in Personal Brand A’s uploads.
3. You later connect the same WhatsApp number to Personal Brand B.
   - Personal Brand A disconnects automatically.
   - New memos will now appear in Personal Brand B.
