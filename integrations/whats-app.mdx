Once connected, you’ll receive a confirmation message in WhatsApp with:

- Instructions on how to submit your inputs
- A **Visit FAQ** link (to this help article)
- An **Unsubscribe** button (to disconnect)

## Step 2: Send Voice or Text Memos

After connecting your device:

- Open the chat in WhatsApp.
- Record a **voice memo** or type a **text message**.
- Send it as you normally would.

**What happens next:**

- Scripe processes your memo.
- You’ll receive a confirmation link in WhatsApp.
- Your memo appears in Scripe under your [project uploads](/sidebar/uploads).

## Manage Your WhatsApp Connection

You can manage connections anytime from your **Settings → Personal Brand → Whatsapp Connections**.

Options available:

- **Add** a connection
- **Remove** existing connection

<Warning>
  **A WhatsApp number can only be active on one personal brand at a time.** If you connect your device to a new project, it will automatically disconnect from the previous one.
</Warning>

**Example workflow for switching your WhatsApp connection to another Personal Brand:**

1. You connect your WhatsApp to Personal Brand A.
2. You send a voice memo. It shows up in Personal Brand A’s uploads.
3. You later connect the same WhatsApp number to Personal Brand B.
   - Personal Brand A disconnects automatically.
   - New memos will now appear in Personal Brand B.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use WhatsApp Web or does it have to be my mobile app?">
    You can use both. Once your device is connected to Scripe, you’re free to send memos from either the mobile app or WhatsApp Web — whichever is more convenient.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take for a memo to appear in Scripe?">
    Your memo is processed almost instantly. In most cases, it will appear in Scripe within just a few seconds of sending it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many memos I can send?">
    There’s no strict limit on the number of memos you can upload. However, we recommend using good judgment to keep your workspace organized and easy to manage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will disconnecting delete my previously uploaded memos?">
    No. Disconnecting only stops new memos from coming in. Any memos you’ve already uploaded will remain safely stored in your Personal Brand.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to reconnect every time I log out of Scripe?">
    No, you don’t. Once your WhatsApp device is connected, the link remains active until you choose to disconnect it manually. Logging out of Scripe won’t affect the connection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can team members use the same WhatsApp number, or does each person need their own?">
    Each Personal Brand can only be linked to one WhatsApp number at a time. If multiple team members share access to the same WhatsApp number, they can all use it for sending memos to the same Personal Brand.
