Scripe connects seamlessly with Slack so your team can stay updated, collaborate faster, and never miss an important post or review.

You can set up two types of Slack integrations:

1. **Slack Engagement Channel** – Share new posts automatically into a Slack channel.
2. **Slack Notifications** – Get personal notifications about reviews, comments, and updates directly in your Slack DMs.

## 1. Slack Engagement Channel

Keep your team in the loop by posting Scripe updates into a dedicated Slack channel.

### How it works

- Whenever a post scheduled through Scripe is published, an update is sent to your selected Slack channel.
- Posts published directly on LinkedIn (outside Scripe) will also trigger updates if you have a connected personal brand. These may appear with a short delay due to external detection.

### Setup Steps

1. Go to **Integrations \> Slack Engagement Channel**.
2. Choose a Slack channel (e.g., `#linkedin-engagement`) to connect.
3. Once connected, every published post will be posted in the channel.
4. Click on the `...` and **Settings** to enable or disable `@channel` mentions for higher visibility, or **Delete** to delete the connection.

**Example:**\
When a new LinkedIn post goes live from a Personal Brand within your workspace, your team will see:

- A short text preview of the post + the name of the Personal Brand that published it.
- A direct link to “View on LinkedIn”

## 2. Slack Notifications

Stay on top of your personal Scripe tasks and feedback directly in Slack.

### How it works

- Notifications are sent to your direct messages with the Scripe Slack app.
- Each team member connects their Slack individually — this ensures notifications are personal and not shared across the whole workspace.

### Setup Steps

1. Go to **Integrations \> Slack Notifications** and click **Connect**.
2. Approve the Slack app to connect with your account.
3. Configure which updates you want to receive:
   - **Post review assigned** – When you’re asked to review a post.
   - **Post review completed** – When a review you requested is finished.
   - **Post comments** – When comments are added to a post.

## Best Practices

- Use the **Engagement Channel** for team-wide visibility and quick engagement on posts.
- Use **Notifications** to stay accountable for your personal tasks and reviews.
- Combine both for maximum visibility and streamlined collaboration.
