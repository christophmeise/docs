If you have a YouTube video you'd like to repurpose into LinkedIn content, this feature helps you break it down into several post-ready drafts. It works well for webinars, interviews, podcasts, and any other long-form videos.

## How It Works

1. Click **Create posts**
2. Select **“YouTube to content”**
3. Add the full link to your video in the field labeled _Enter YouTube Link_.
4. Click on **"Create posts from YouTube"** to see the posts generated from your file (this may take a few minutes; you don't need to refresh the page)

### Optional: Add to Knowledge Base

Toggle on **“Add to Knowledge Base”** to save the file’s content to your Knowledge Base. Scripe will learn from it and generate even more personalized posts over time.

<Tip>
  Only toggle it for content that reflects your tone, ideas, or expertise. Want to learn more? [Read how the Knowledge Base works →](/sidebar/knowledge)

## After Uploading a File: Post Ideas & Scoring

Once your video is uploaded to Scripe, you'll be taken to a screen that helps you generate and refine LinkedIn post ideas based on your content.

### What You’ll See

- **Post Ideas:** Scripe generates multiple post drafts based on the file you uploaded (e.g., audio, video, PDF, etc.).
- **Post Score:** Each post idea is ranked using a **content score**, which evaluates how well the post aligns with key performance factors such as Goal alignment, Engagement potential and Value and insights.
- **Strategy Tags:** Scripe highlights the strategic intent behind each post, such as: generating leads, attracting partners, educating your audience, building credibility, etc.
- **Hooks:** Each post suggestion comes with scroll-stopping hooks. You can:
  - Click on the arrows to preview all the different hook variations
  - Favorite the ones you like most
  - Use any hook to instantly create a full post

<Tip>
  Start with the highest-scoring posts, then refine based on your tone and goals. You can always tweak the hook or structure later in the [post editor](/editor/editor).
