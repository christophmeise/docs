Scripe can generate weekly post ideas for you: no prompt needed. These suggestions are based on your content strategy, posting goals, and personal tone.

## How it works:

1. Every week, Scripe automatically suggests new LinkedIn posts for you, based on:
   - Your selected [**content strategy**](/sidebar/content-strategy)
   - Your **activity targets** (how many posts you want to publish that month)
   - Insights from your [**Knowledge Base**](/sidebar/knowledge) and past posts
2. **Click any suggestion to open and edit:** When you click on a suggestion, you’ll see a preview of the full post. You can edit and format the text or generate alternative versions using different hooks in the [post editor](/editor/editor). Once you’re happy with it, just hit [**Publish**](/editor/schedule).
3. **Personalization improves with input:** The more content you add to Scripe, the smarter your weekly suggestions get. These help Scripe identify opportunities you might not have thought of, so you're not starting from scratch every week.
4. **Customize your strategy anytime:** You’re always in control. You can adjust your content focus and monthly targets under your [Content Strategy settings](/sidebar/content-strategy) in your dashboard.

  **Tip:** Try the [**Content Interview**](/multiple-posts/interview) to quickly update Scripe on recent news, wins, or reflections. It’s a great way to feed your [Knowledge Base](/sidebar/knowledge) with fresh context.
