Scripe can generate weekly post ideas for you: no prompt needed. These suggestions are based on your content strategy, posting goals, and personal tone.

## How it works:

Every week, Scripe automatically suggests new LinkedIn posts for you, based on:

- Your selected **content strategy**
- Your **activity targets** (how many posts you want to publish that month)
- Insights from your **Knowledge Base** and past posts

Clicking any of these suggestions will open your post drafts that are within the topic, ready to be published, so you can schedule or tweak them right away.

When you hover over a weekly suggestion, you’ll see two actions:

- **Edit post**: Opens the post editor so you can work on the LinkedIn draft.
- **Add to chat**: Sends the post idea into Chat, where you can brainstorm, refine, expand, or re-angle it.

You can find all of your post suggestions in the [Posts page](/sidebar/posts) on your left sidebar.

<Note>
  **Personalization improves with input:** The more content you add to Scripe, the smarter your weekly suggestions get. These help Scripe identify opportunities you might not have thought of, so you're not starting from scratch every week.

  **Tip:** Try the [**Content Interview**](/post/interview) to quickly update Scripe on recent news, wins, or reflections. It’s a great way to feed your [Knowledge Base](/sidebar/knowledge) with fresh context.
