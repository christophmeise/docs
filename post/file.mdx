The **Upload file to content** feature lets you turn existing materials into posts. You can upload any type of files, from audio or video to document files, such as podcasts, meeting recordings, case studies, or presentation decks, and Scripe will generate multiple posts from them.

## How It Works

1. Click **Create posts**
2. Select **“Upload file to content”**
3. Drag and drop your file or click **browse** to upload
4. Click on **"See generated posts"** to see the posts generated from your file (this may take a few minutes; you don't need to refresh the page)

Supported formats include:

- **Audio**: MP3, M4A
- **Video**: MP4
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX
- **Max size:** 2GB

### Optional: Add to Knowledge Base

Toggle on **“Add to Knowledge Base”** to save the file’s content to your Knowledge Base. Scripe will learn from it and generate even more personalized posts over time.

<Tip>
  Only toggle it for content that reflects your tone, ideas, or expertise. Want to learn more? [Read how the Knowledge Base works →](/sidebar/knowledge)

## After Uploading a File: Post Ideas & Scoring

Once your file is uploaded to Scripe, you'll be taken to a screen that helps you generate and refine LinkedIn post ideas based on your content.

### What You’ll See

- **Post Ideas:** Scripe generates multiple post drafts based on the file you uploaded (e.g., audio, video, PDF, etc.).
- **Post Score:** Each post idea is ranked using a **content score**, which evaluates how well the post aligns with key performance factors such as Goal alignment, Engagement potential and Value and insights.
- **Strategy Tags:** Scripe highlights the strategic intent behind each post, such as: generating leads, attracting partners, educating your audience, building credibility, etc.
- **Hooks:** Each post suggestion comes with scroll-stopping hooks. You can:
  - Click on the arrows to preview all the different hook variations
  - Favorite the ones you like most
  - Use any hook to instantly create a full post

<Tip>
  Start with the highest-scoring posts, then refine based on your tone and goals. You can always tweak the hook or structure later in the [post editor](/editor/editor).
