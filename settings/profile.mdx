## Country & Address

On your Profile page, you’ll see two optional fields: Country and Address. These are only required if you’re actively using [Scripe’s referral program](/settings/referrals).

If you share your referral link and generate commission, Scripe needs your country and address to process payouts correctly and comply with international payment requirements. If you’re not using referrals, you can leave these fields empty.

To update these fields, select your country from the dropdown and enter your address in the text box.

## Actions You Can Perform

- Update your profile details by clicking **Update profile**.
- Add or remove email addresses.
- Change your primary email if needed (by setting another verified email as primary).
- Connect or disconnect LinkedIn or Google accounts for single sign-on (SSO).
