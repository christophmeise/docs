The **Personal Brand** page on Scripe allows you to manage your personal brand’s account details, update your LinkedIn profile link, transfer ownership, or delete your personal brand entirely.

<Info>
  In Scripe, a **Personal Brand** refers to the LinkedIn profile you manage through the platform. You can manage multiple Personal Brands on the Team plan, and a single Personal Brand in the Starter and Professional Plans.

## Upload Images to train AI

- Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg
- Maximum size: 10 MB per image

## WhatsApp Connections
