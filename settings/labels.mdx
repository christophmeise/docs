The **Labels** feature helps you keep your posts organized across the entire workspace.

You can use labels to categorize content by any type of categorization or system that fits your company’s communication strategy.

You can manage workspace-wide labels under: **Settings → Labels**

## Workspace-Level Feature

Labels are a **workspace feature**, meaning they apply across your entire company account.

Each personal brand within your workspace can view and apply these labels when creating or scheduling posts.

<Tip>
  While personal brands can create additional labels if needed, we recommend setting up **company-wide labels** to keep your workspace organized and consistent.

## Creating and Managing Labels

From the **Labels** tab, you can:

- Click **New label** to create a new label
- Click **New group** to organize labels under a shared category
- Add a **description** to clarify what each label should be used for
- See when each label was **last applied** and **created**

### Best Practices

- Keep label names short, clear, and action-oriented.
- Group related labels (e.g., “Product Demos” → “Videos” and “Screenshots”).
- Regularly review and clean up unused labels to maintain clarity.

## How Labels Work in Posts

When creating or editing a post, you can assign one or more labels to help categorize it.

For example:

- “Product Update” for release announcements
- “HR Activations” for role openings
- “Community Challenge” for engagement initiatives
- “Product Videos” for posts that include product demos

These labels make it easier to filter, analyze, and measure the performance of your company’s content later in the [Analytics](/workspace/team-analytics) views.
