- Click on **Manage Subscription** to open your subscription details.
- Here you can:
  - **Cancel or Renew** your current subscription by clicking the button next to your active plan.
  - **Edit your payment details** by updating the saved payment method.

## Personal Brands (Agency Plan)

If you’re on the **Agency plan**, your Billing page includes a **Personal Brands** section.

This shows how many LinkedIn accounts (personal brands) you’ve connected compared to the number included in your plan — for example, `1 / 3`.

Each personal brand represents one LinkedIn profile that you manage in Scripe. The tracker helps you see at a glance:

- How many brands are currently active
- How much room you have before needing to scale your plan
- Which workspaces those brands belong to

As you add more LinkedIn accounts, the counter updates automatically. If you go beyond the number included in your plan, your subscription will scale accordingly, with pricing adjusted based on the Agency plan’s volume discounts.
