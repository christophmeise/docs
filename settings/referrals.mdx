The Referrals page in Scripe allows you to earn rewards by inviting others to join Scripe.

Every time someone signs up using your referral link:

- They receive **4 weeks of Scripe for free.**
- You earn **20% lifetime commission** on every subscription payment they make.

No limits. No expiration. As long as they stay with Scripe, you keep earning.

<Info>
  If you’d like to take things a step further and **become an official Scripe Partner** — integrating Scripe into your own offers, services, or client systems — you can [apply to our Partner Program here](https://scripe.io/partners).

  As a partner, you’ll get access to exclusive resources, co-marketing opportunities, and higher commission tiers.

## Where to find your referral link

To find your referral link, go to your Workspace Settings → Referrals.

In this page, you’ll find your **unique referral link**.

- Click **Copy link** to copy your link to your clipboard.
- Share it anywhere: LinkedIn posts, DMs, newsletters, WhatsApp, etc.

<Tip>
  The referral only tracks if the person signs up directly through your unique link.

## Add Payment Details (so we can pay you!)

Before commissions can be paid out, Scripe needs your payout information.

On the Referrals page, click: **Complete Profile → Add your country and address to receive referral payments.**

Once completed, you’ll receive an email (via Dots) to set up your preferred payment method.\
You only need to do this once — after that, all payouts will be automatically transferred to you every month.

<Warning>
  Payments are only processed once you’ve reached the **minimum threshold of \$50** in commissions.
</Warning>
