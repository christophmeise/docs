Scripe’s affiliate program is a simple way for users to earn commission by referring others to the platform.

If someone signs up for a paid plan using your personal referral link, you receive a percentage of that payment, every month, for as long as they stay subscribed.

No prior experience is needed to join, and everything is handled through your affiliate dashboard.

## How it works

1. **Get your referral link:** Once you join the program, you’ll receive a personal affiliate link.
2. **Share it with your audience:** Post it on LinkedIn, include it in newsletters, or send it to a friend who might love Scripe. [Learn more about this here →](/affiliate/share)
3. **Earn commission:** For every person who signs up for a paid Scripe plan via your link, you earn **20% recurring commission**, for as long as they stay subscribed.

### Where to find your link

Your referral link and stats live inside your **Affiliate Dashboard**. You’ll see:

- How many people clicked your link
- How many signed up
- How much commission you’ve earned
