If you’re part of [Scripe’s Partner Program](/affiliate/program), here’s how to make the most of it.

## Find Your Partner Link

- Go to your affiliate dashboard and scroll down to **Referral Links**.
- Customize the token if you'd like a personalized link.
- You can create different links for different platforms to track performance.

## Create a Personalised Tracking Code

Tracking coupons can be shared without a referral link, and sales will be tracked. 

- Go to your affiliate dashboard and scroll down to **Tracking Coupons**.
- Click on **Create coupon code**.
- Personalise it to your liking, and it's ready to share.
- This tracking code also gives your clients \$25 off their first month of Scripe.

## Share Your Link & Code Effectively

Once your link is set up, make sure all your clients use it when signing up to Scripe.

We also recommend that you share it on platforms where people already value your recommendations:

- **Social Media:** LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube
- **Web:** Blog posts, personal websites, podcasts, eBooks
- **Private Communities:** Newsletters, Telegram groups, WhatsApp communities

The goal isn’t to post everywhere but to post where you already have people listening.

  **Important:** Sharing your Partner link or Scripe coupons on coupon/discount websites is strictly forbidden and will result in immediate removal from the program.
