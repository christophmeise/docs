Scripe rewards you for every paying customer you refer — and not just once. When someone signs up using your referral link and subscribes to a paid plan, you earn **20% commission on all of their payments, for life**.

Here’s what you need to know about how commission works and when you’ll get paid:

## How the Commission Works

- You receive **20% of every payment** made by customers who subscribed **through your partner link.**
- This applies to **all plan types**, and the commission is **recurring**, meaning you keep earning every month the customer stays subscribed.
- There’s **no cap** on how many referrals you can make.

## Payment Schedule

- Commissions are **paid monthly**, at the **first two weeks of the following month**.
  - Example: If you earn \$80 in June, you’ll receive that payment in the first two weeks of July.
- Payments are only processed if your **payout balance is over \$50**.

### How to Set Up Your Payout Details

To make sure you get paid:

1. Go to your **Affiliate Dashboard**.
2. Head to **Profile Settings**.
3. Fill out your **Country** and **Address** (these are required for payment processing).
4. On your **first payout**, you’ll receive an email from First Promoter (Via Dots) prompting you to set up your payment method.
5. After setup, all future payments are automatic.

  **Reminder:** Make sure your email is always up to date in your profile settings so you don’t miss payment setup notifications or updates from the Scripe team.
